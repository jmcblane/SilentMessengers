<p>I'm not going to make a moving appeal or break your heart with begging. I am currently working as a self-supporting colporteur missionary. I live on miracles. Suffice to say, God takes care of His own. This page is just to provide a means by which, if He so chooses, He can provide for me through folks like you.</p>
<p>If you are impressed by the Holy Spirit to give, give that which the Lord puts on your heart. Our treasure is in heaven, friends. May the Lord richly bless you through the revelation of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior; who gave His life that we, poisoned by the serpent, might find peace and everlasting life through beholding what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us.</p>
