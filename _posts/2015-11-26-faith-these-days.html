<p>I see quite often questions such as "Why do you believe?" or "What proof do you have?" and "Why is your religion true and everything else wrong?" Indeed, the scripture says, "I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour." (Isaiah 43:11). Again, Christ says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." (John 14:6).</p>
<p>This is a pretty big claim. Surely, to make such a seemingly arrogant statement of fact, there must be some corroborating evidence to support it, right? Consider: God is the infinitely wise omnipotent King of Kings. He is infinitely loving, merciful, and just. He would not leave us here to stumble around in the dark trying to catch a black cricket.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Remember the former things of old:</em><br />
<em>for I am God, and there is none else;</em><br />
<em>I am God, and there is none like me,</em><br />
<em> Declaring the end from the beginning,</em><br />
<em>and from ancient times the things that are not yet done,</em><br />
<em>saying, My counsel shall stand,</em><br />
<em>and I will do all my pleasure.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Isaiah 46:9-10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have our answer, straight from the Lord Himself. "Remember the former things of old," and why? "for I am God, and there is none else... Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done..." To paraphrase, "Study history, for I am God. I tell the future." Your history teacher would certainly appreciate this plug.</p>
<p>The sure word of prophecy is our lamp in the darkness. When we use it with oil (a symbol of the Holy Spirit, Zech 4:2-6, Rev 4:5), the light shines bright and dispels the darkness. To take it one step further, God's word is creative (Genesis 1). This means that, since what God speaks happens, every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God is inherently prophetic.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Produce your cause, saith the LORD;</em><br />
<em> bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.</em><br />
<em> Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen:</em><br />
<em> let them shew the former things, what they be,</em><br />
<em> that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them;</em><br />
<em> or declare us things for to come.</em><br />
<em> Shew the things that are to come hereafter,</em><br />
<em> that we may know that ye are gods:</em><br />
<em> yea, do good, or do evil,</em><br />
<em> that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.</em><br />
<em> Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought:</em><br />
<em> an abomination is he that chooseth you.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Isaiah 41:21-24</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peter says, "We have a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed..." Indeed, God holds His word of prophecy as such strong evidence of His divinity that He goes as far as to say that even the man who chooses another is an abomination for this reason; no other can truly reveal the future. Jesus adds more depth to this sentiment with two powerful and concise statements:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">John 13:19</p>
<p><em>And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">John 14:29</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word here for 'believe' in both cases is Strong's G4100, pisteuo, and the definition is "to have faith." Christ is revealing something to us: faith is given and strengthened by fulfilled prophecies. Truly, if we want to have a faith that does not waver based on emotion, it must be grounded in the word. The infinite loving character of God is enough to convince us, but the sure word of prophecy plants us firmly on the Rock that doesn't budge.</p>
<p>We see this demonstrated by the apostles time and time again, but there is one story in particular which really drives this point home. Starting in Luke 24:13 is the story of the two disciples walking to Emmaus. They've just witnessed the death of the One whom they thought would take the throne and throw off the Roman yoke. They're confused, depressed, and to top it off they're facing a six mile walk to think about it. This is a prime situation to begin to doubt, and indeed they surely were tempted to, but Jesus comes in to the rescue.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<br />
...<br />
And they said one to another, 'Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?' And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem...</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Luke 24:27,32,33</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus revealed to them all of the prophecy which had been fulfilled in the scriptures, and this turned their countenances completely around. Not only did they lose all sadness and despair; they got back up and immediately walked the six miles back to where they just came from to tell everyone else. When's the last time you walked six miles to get somewhere and then decided to turn around and walk back? This wasn't any ordinary whim; they recognized the phenomenal oracle we call the holy scriptures as the inspired word of God; and in these, they discerned now His Son.</p>
<p>Upon their arrival, these two bear testimony of Jesus. They tell the other disciples, and soon, Christ himself appears. Rather than being happy to see Him, the disciples are terrified that it might be a deceiving spirit. Christ proceeds to let them handle his hands and feet, showing them the marks, and in verse 41 it says "...they yet believe not..." Even still there was doubt in their hearts.</p>
<p>Certainly this had been an extremely trying ordeal. The disciples, though having been with Jesus, were still keeping the hope that He would overthrow the hypocrites and set up his kingdom at that time. They did not fully understand the scriptures, but all this changes.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And [Jesus] said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.<br />
...<br />
And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Luke 24:44-45, 52-53</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, he opens their eyes to understand all the things which were foretold, and they <em>worship</em> him. Indeed, at this time, Christ's words were coming to memory in which he told them he would be betrayed. When they understood what had come to pass in light of the scripture, everything clicked into place, and their faith became solid like diamond.</p>
<p>So, what does that mean for us?</p>
<p>We live at a unique time in history. We have the inspired testimony of Jesus that records all of history from the beginning to the end. The books of Daniel and Revelation contain the history of the world from the time of Christ up to and beyond the present time. We can look back on all of history, history book and Bible side by side, and compare the revelation of God with what has come to pass. Indeed, we can do this with the entire book! There are very few prophecies left unfulfilled at this point, and some of those are fulfilling right before our very eyes with rapidity.</p>
<p>Satan knows that his time is short. Most of the Protestant world has moved away from the truths discovered all throughout the Reformation. They keep holy the first day of the week, when the scriptures explicitly state to keep the seventh day of the week; yet, most don't know why. Satan has done a wonderful job pulling the wool over the eyes of God's sheep, scattering them into many folds with many a deception. The old ways have been forgotten, and the tried and true interpretation of prophecy has been usurped by doctrines that suggest eschatology is entirely unimportant.</p>
<p>What a deception!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; <strong>but the wise shall understand.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Daniel 12:8-10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want to be wise, yes? The foolish virgins could not enter the door. We need to understand the books of Daniel and Revelation. They are meant to be understood.</p>
<p>God has a plan. He wrote all of this down, in detail, in advance. He preserved His word that we might compare line with line, precept with precept, and discern what is truth. Revelation 10 shows us a powerful scene in which the little book of Daniel is opened up. Daniel was the only sealed book in the scriptures, but here we see it is opened. The time of the end is upon us, It's time for us to take up the little book and eat it, "and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey." (Rev 10:9). When we do, God says to us, "Thou must prophecy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings." (Rev 10:11).</p>
<p>I would like to share a couple quotes from Ellen G. White:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The burden of Christ's preaching was, "<a href="http://amazingdiscoveries.org/S-deception_Jesus_70-week_prophecy_Daniel">The time is fulfilled</a>, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel." Thus, the gospel message as given by the Savior Himself was based on fulfilled prophecies.<br />
...<br />
Christ urged upon his disciples the importance of prophetic study. Referring to the prophecy given to Daniel in regard to their time, He said, "Whoso readeth, let him understand."</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Desire of Ages, pg 233-234</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are prophecies in the book of Daniel, as well as Revelation, which pertain to our time right now. Thus, Christ's words and example apply to us today. The gospel message is driven by fulfilled prophecy, and we who read the scripture need to understand.</p>
<p>I have placed excellent resources in the sidebar, and welcome any and all questions. I encourage anyone who has not seen <a href="//www.revelationmystery.com">Revelation: The Bride, the Beast, and Babylon</a> to watch it (free to watch). Set your preconceptions aside and hear the message, then study the scripture to see if these things be so. (Proverbs 18:13, Acts 17:11-12). May God guide anyone who reads this with His Holy Spirit and lead them to the truth.</p>
