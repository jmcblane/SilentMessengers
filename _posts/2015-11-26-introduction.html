<blockquote>
<em>He that answereth a matter before he heareth it,<br />
it is folly and shame unto him.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Proverbs 18:13</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've chosen this title for one reason and one reason only; this is one of many important truths we need to meditate upon and digest. How often do we reject something at a glance? Regardless of the reason, whether it just seems too unreal or it's outside of what we've always known, this reaction is detrimental to our well being intellectually and spiritually. It takes humility to hear out a matter and consider it, especially when that matter is painful or strange to us.</p>
<p>There can only be one truth. We must be fully aware at all times of why we believe what we believe. Some things we accept simply because we've grown up being told that's the way it is. Other things we accept because someone we respect insists upon them. We're doing ourselves a disservice if we do not dig out the roots of our faith. If the ore is not purged of the dross, what good is the metal?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Jude 3-4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we are to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints, that means we can know it. We have at our disposal the entire record of human history, written by inspired men, moved by the Holy Ghost. We must study to show ourselves approved (2 Timothy 2:15). "If they speak not according to this word, there is no light in them." (Isaiah 8:20). How can we know if they speak according to this word unless we know it?</p>
<p>Consider Mary and Martha. Martha worked fervently to try and please Christ and her company. She missed every word that Christ said in an effort to gain favor through an offering of materials, sweat, and time. In contrast, Mary sat at the feet of Christ, intently listening to his every word. Martha is too busy to hear anything he has to say, and interrupting his words, she says "Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?" In a way she is telling him what to do, as if to say, "Master, make her do something!" Listen to the words of Jesus:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Luke 10:41-42</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be wise to take a page out of Mary's book and listen to the words of Christ. We know that he and the Father are One, and we know that Christ is found in all of scripture. This book that we have today is no ordinary book; it is the very testimony of Jesus. These are his words as he would have us read them, and to all of us, like Mary, he calls us to sit at his feet and listen to what he has to say.</p>
<p>The high ranking Jews preferred the word of the men in great positions of authority over the word of the lowly carpenter. They think among themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>'Are ye deceived? Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?'</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">John 7:47</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And thus, trusting in themselves and their own understanding, they rejected the truth. They hated Christ because the people followed after him, like sheep following the voice of the familiar shepherd. Those who had been exalted in the temple were snared by pride and a desire for popularity. They feared to lose their followers because, after all, they saw them as their followers and their sheep rather than the sheep of God.</p>
<p>We must be very careful not to fall into the same trap. The people knew their shepherds voice because the Holy Spirit had been speaking to them all along. We have the oracles of God - the truth in plain text - to be accessed at our leisure! We have the promise of God to teach us with His Holy Spirit! We have more light than any other generation, which means we have more responsibility; especially to discern for ourselves what is truth and what is error.</p>
<p>Thus, we musn't fall into the trap of hearing men above the word of God. Wherever Christ leads; there we must follow. "We ought to obey God rather than men," says Peter (Acts 5:29). The Bereans give us a beautiful example of exactly how we can practically apply this to our lives this very day:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. These were <span style="text-decoration:underline;">more noble</span> than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</span> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Acts 17:10-11</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truth can be painful, but God's word is for us - not against us. Remember Proverbs 18:13 the next time something comes up to which you do not instantly agree with, and remember the brethren in Berea. We cannot depend on the wisdom of another to save us. We need the mind of Christ in these trying times.</p>
