<p>I find often it's easy to get into the habit of projecting what we read in the scriptures outward onto others rather than applying them internally. As Christ said,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote our of thy brother's eye.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Luke 13:15</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found myself falling into the trap of looking outwardly and missing the inward picture. Fortunately, since God's sent me on this trip through the doctrine of righteousness by faith, it's becoming easier to apply inwardly the lessons that I'm finding in the scripture.</p>
<p>I want to share one of these inward applications that the Lord revealed to me today. It comes from a text that, at first, might not seem to have much inward application... However; today, the scripture rang loud and clear to my heart. Truly, it's only after a correct understanding of salvation that this text makes sense. <a href="http://www.surrenderpeace.org">Greg Jackson</a> was right when he said, "Surrender is the key to understanding the scripture." (paraphrasing).</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>And Jesus went into the <strong>temple of God</strong>, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,<br />
And said unto them, "It is written, <strong>My house shall be called the house of prayer</strong>; but ye have made it a den of thieves."</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Matthew 21:12-13</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first, second, and even tenth reading... I must say that this text didn't exactly say much to me. I understood mentally how these folks were not only breaking the Sabbath, but also abusing the people and using them in their time of need. The objective moral lesson is quite clear with a little understanding of what's going on here. Folks needed sacrifices, and the priests were selling animals without blemish to make an extra buck; on top of that, using an in-house currency which was even further scamming the people.</p>
<p>However; let's apply a few more spiritual principles and dig out a deeper truth, shall we?</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">1 Corinthians 3:16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of us know this verse well. When we apply it practically, we can recognize that the temple of God in the scripture serves as an object lesson of the Great Controversy being waged inside of us. In the text from Matthew, we see outwardly what happens far too easily to us all inwardly. Our temple, which is to be called a house of prayer, we have made a den of thieves.</p>
<p>Remember when Christ said, "You cannot serve God and mammon."? Here, in this story, is an example of just that. We, within ourselves, are often busy and noisy with all of the problems we create for ourselves. We think about how much gas is in the car, how much food is in the pantry, if our kids have what they need, how we're going to pay that loan we took out, when that next bill is due... Why are we worried about these things? Because we don't trust God.</p>
<p>True rest is found when we have ceased from our own works, relying wholly upon Jesus Christ. (Hebrews 4:4). Yes, the Sabbath is Saturday, but there is so much more than that. The scripture says,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Isaiah 26:3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perfect peace is found in a house of prayer. When our minds are stayed on Christ, ever in prayer and never worrying about the things of this world, we will have the fruit of the Spirit that is peace. When we surrender to Christ and let Him in; when we step down from the throne of God in our hearts; when we lean on God and trust in Him to take care of us: It is then that we find rest and cease from our own works. It is only then that we can truly keep the Sabbath holy, because we are not doing works of the flesh but rather Christ is doing works through us  whilst we are simply resting in Him.</p>
<p>We're trying to serve God and mammon. This is not possible. We work and work and work, living paycheck to paycheck, and then praise God one day a week in which we are simply taking a break from serving mammon to pay lip service to God. As it is put in 2 Timothy 3:5, "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof..."</p>
<p>Christ is waiting for us to stop trying to keep the law ourselves and grab hold of His strength to make us law keepers. He's waiting for us to stop trying to save ourselves; stop trying to earn heaven; stop depending upon self; and start trusting in Him. That paycheck is not what's taking care of you; God is. When we let Jesus in, He casts out the money changers in your heart and restores the silence of the temple. When we let Him in, He does the work of restoring this temple to the house of prayer it is meant to be.</p>
<p>When we let Christ in, we will not only have a form of godliness, but we will have the power that comes with. Look at what happens in the story after the din is gone and peace returns:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em> And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Matthew 21:14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Christ is in us; When we are resting in Him: Then others will see Him in us and come to us to be healed. It is then that the gospel will be taken into all the world <strong>as a witness</strong>, not just as a nice theological concept. The power of the gospel has been lacking. Christ has promised not only to forgive our past sins, but to come and dwell within us: cleansing us from all unrighteousness! He promises to cover the sins of the past and perfect our character so that we no longer want to sin! He promises to change our heart like the potter and the clay! The greatest part of all? He is the only one who can do it, and He is faithful to do so!</p>
<p>He's waiting for us to get out of the way and let Him work. He's waiting for us to take up our cross, not to carry and moan, but to <strong>climb upon it and crucify self</strong>. The sparrows cry out to God; they don't rely on their money to eat. God will take care of you; start caring for others and forget about yourself. (I'm speaking to myself, also).</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; <strong>which is Christ in you</strong>, the hope of glory: Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man <strong>perfect in Christ Jesus</strong>: Whereunto I also labour, striving according to <strong>his</strong> working, <strong>which worketh in me</strong> mightily.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Colossians 1:27-29</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've never heard it put more succinctly than Brother Jackson does whom I mentioned earlier. The key is <strong>surrender</strong>. Everything we do in the power of the flesh is sin, because in our flesh is nothing good and all our righteousness is as filthy rags. All our good works amount to nothing without Christ. Good works are a fruit of abiding in Him, and unless He is doing the work in us, it is still sin that works in us.</p>
<p>We must be changed at our core from the inside out, and only the High Priest can go into the Most Holy place of the soul temple and make atonement: cleansing the sanctuary from defilement and reconciling man to God. He works in us and through us to save us. Our job is simply to surrender to His working and walk in the Spirit, taking it day by day, until we may be presented faultless before the throne of God. Christ's sacrifice justifies us, and the ministry of Christ sanctifies us, until we are covered by the blood <strong>and</strong> without sin.</p>
<p>We have to stop trying to be holy and let Christ change us. We cannot keep the commandments ourselves, we need Christ in us. When He works in us, He keeps the commandments, and therefor we won't break them. If Christ is working in us always; we will be free from sin. Surrender is the key... Surrender.</p>
