<blockquote><em>Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</em></p>
<p>But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">James 1:21-25</p>

<p>It's no secret that the gospel is the central message of scripture for man. It's one of the most fundamental and important truths we need to understand, especially considering it's the gospel which we are to proclaim to the world. Jesus says the gospel must be preached to all nations, and the first angel of Revelation 14 is found carrying the everlasting gospel.</p>
<p>So, question: Does it not make sense, then, that the gospel would be a primary target for Satan to attack?</p>
<p>I believe the answer to this question is yes, and I see pits on both sides of the narrow road for folks to fall in. One one hand, there is liberalism; going too far to the left. On the other hand we have legalism, going too far to the right. One provides false assurance, and the other provides works righteousness; both of which are wrong. My goal here is not to dig into the theological details or nitpick this and that. I hope that by picking up a few stories from scripture to illustrate the message of salvation, we might find just a little more light to encourage us to take the message of righteousness by faith and sink our teeth into it. What was once foundational, I believe, has been nearly lost in today's world.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.</em></p>
<p>Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Genesis 1:1-3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Genesis 1, in my opinion, gives us a pretty clear picture of the problem. If anything, Genesis 1 provides an explanation of righteousness by faith in its simplest form.</p>
<p>Notice: God speaks and it stands fast.</p>
<p>This is the story throughout the whole chapter. "For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast." (Psalm 33:9). All of creation operates this way, in harmony with God's will, all the way up until God creates man. Everything implicitly obeys the word of the Lord, but on day six, something special happens:</p>
<p>God creates man.</p>
<p>Now, when God speaks to man, man has a choice: obey or disobey. Adam was created with a tendency toward obedience to God's will. Adam walked in harmony with God's will as did all of creation, and everything was "very good." However; when Adam sinned, no longer was this the case. He came at odds with all of creation, which obeys God. Thus, the problem: Sin, which is the transgression of the will of God.</p>
<p>We have inherited the tendency to choose disobedience from Adam. Jesus Christ also inherited this, but He proved that even in the fallen condition, man is able to obey the commandments of God. He did this through the power of the Holy Spirit, by obeying the promptings of the Spirit. Thus, the commandments of God are far more than the rules laid out in scripture: The commandments of God are every word which proceeds out of the mouth of God - every conviction the Holy Spirit brings to our heart. (Not to shut out the scriptures, for by the law is the knowledge of sin!)</p>
<p>The promise, then, is that if we believe and follow the promptings of the Holy Spirit; God will lead us to the promised land. It's the same promise given Abraham. We have the assurance of righteousness by faith, in that, by faith, God guides us into the inheritance of righteousness.</p>
<p>Let's look at another (hopefully) familiar story, shall we?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master, because by him the Lord had given victory to Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor, but a leper. And the Syrians had gone out on raids, and had brought back captive a young girl from the land of Israel. She waited on Naaman’s wife. Then she said to her mistress, “If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy.” And Naaman went in and told his master, saying, “Thus and thus said the girl who is from the land of Israel.”</em></p>
<p>Then the king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.”</p>
<p>So he departed and took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">2 Kings 5:1-5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the introduction to our story. I want to highlight a few details which are going to be important for the point being made. First up, Naaman is a leper. Leprosy is quite commonly known for being a wonderful symbol for sin. Thus, in this story, keep in mind that Naaman's leprosy is symbolic of sin. Second, notice he goes prepared to purchase healing. Naaman is chief among the Syrians, a heathen nation, and we see the concept of works righteousness in his thinking: "I must give in order to receive."</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Then he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which said,</em></p>
<p>Now be advised, when this letter comes to you, that I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.</p>
<p>And it happened, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and make alive, that this man sends a man to me to heal him of his leprosy? Therefore please consider, and see how he seeks a quarrel with me.”</p>
<p>So it was, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”</p>
<p>Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and he stood at the door of Elisha’s house.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">2 Kings 5:6-9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it interesting that the leadership in Israel is dumbfounded when someone comes to them for healing. The king of Israel rips his clothes in anguish and assumes that they have come to cause trouble, when in all actuality... Isn't Israel supposed to be representative of the living God? Aren't they entrusted with the oracles of salvation and healing? What unbelief is manifest! Why shouldn't the king of Israel know the way? He very well should!</p>
<p>Fortunately, God has His representatives in this world. Elisha gets wind of this and calls for the man that God may be glorified. Thus, Naaman finds himself standing at the door.</p>
<p>Question: Who is the door? (John 10:9)</p>
<p>So here, Naaman, a leper, finds himself standing before Christ looking to be healed. This is an excellent picture of a sinner approaching Christ for salvation.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and you shall be clean.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">2 Kings 5:10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting. Here, we see a messenger sent to Naaman to give him a command. This messenger is playing the role of the Holy Spirit, "for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak" (John 16:13). Thus, we see what happens when we come to Christ for healing. We are told, "wash and be clean." This flies in the face of most of Christianity today, which says... well let's let scripture tell the story:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>But Naaman became furious, and went away and said, “Indeed, I said to myself, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy.’ Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">2 Kings 5:11-12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most popular gospels of the day suggests exactly what Naaman expected. We want to believe that we come to the door, and Christ comes out, waves His hand over us, and legally declares us to be clean - from which point He proceeds to cleanse us... but that's not what the story says. No, indeed, we come to the door, and we receive a command: wash and be clean! Obedience then is not a fruit of salvation, but it is conditional in order for us to receive cleansing!</p>
<p>It takes more than a mere profession to be justified. We must by faith trust and obey God in order that He might lead us to righteousness. "By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going." (Hebrews 11:8). "Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, 'Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.' And he was called the friend of God." (James 2:22-23)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And his servants came near and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do something great, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?” So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">2 Kings 5:13-14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome." (1 John 5:3). Again, God uses a messenger to reach Naaman for the third time (count 'em), and here we find the same message from 1 John 5:3 in the Old Testament. God's commandments are not burdensome; they are a blessing!</p>
<p>Naaman was upset for two reasons, which really boil down to one: He wanted to purchase his cleansing, but instead found that he had to submit in order to obtain it. He wanted to receive cleansing his own way, as suggested by the cleaner rivers, but found that only God's way was acceptable. In essence, self-surrender is the requirement of God for us to be cleansed from sin. When Naaman submitted to God's commandments, not in the letter but in the Spirit, Naaman was restored. His faith worked through obedience.</p>
<p>Does this mean, then, that Naaman earned it? Never! If he had felt that he had earned it or puchased it, he wouldn't have proceeded to try and pay for it afterward. It is clearly a free gift!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his aides, and came and stood before him; and he said, “Indeed, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel; now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.”</em></p>
<p>But he said, “As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will receive nothing.” And he urged him to take it, but he refused.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">2 Kings 5:15-16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And thus, Naaman learns that cleansing cannot be earned by merit and cannot be bought; it is a free gift found by submission to God in humility. The only sacrifice God requires is the sacrifice of our whole selves. He doesn't want our constant confessions and continual disobedience, but says "Wash you, make you clean; put away your evil doings!" (Isaiah 1:15)</p>
<p>This quote sums it up quite well:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>But while God can be just, and yet justify the sinner through the merits of Christ, no man can cover his soul with the garments of Christ’s righteousness while practicing known sins, or neglecting known duties. God requires the entire surrender of the heart, before justification can take place; and in order for man to retain justification, there must be continual obedience, through active, living faith that works by love and purifies the soul.</em></p>

<p>Now, if this is news to you, don't be discouraged! We're going to look at this from another angle. I wouldn't dare leave you hopeless.</p>
<p>Are you ready for some good news?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had. Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been in that condition a long time, He said to him, “Do you want to be made well?”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">John 5:2-6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the scene: A multitude of people with various sorts of ailments and sicknesses. The water stirs, and hope stirs up in all of them for a short time, at which point they proceed to clobber each other, trample each other, push one another out of the way; all in the hope that they might be first to get in the water and be healed of their disease.</p>
<p>Tell me, is this the method that God heals people? What was Jesus' example? He would weary himself to attend to the needs of every single person who came to Him in a crowd of people. He would make sure to feed each and every person who was within the sound of His voice. The work here at the pool of Bethesda is that of another spirit which likes to cause confusion and despair.</p>
<p>Here, amidst this, we have a man who has been there for only God knows how long. Thirty eight years this man has been pained to be healed from his infirmity. day in and day out, he has been watching the same scene take place, and it leaves him without any hope. This is the same position we're all in, crippled by sin, day in and day out watching the sinful world around us... and it leaves us without any hope. It's dog eat dog in a scene being troubled by fallen angels.</p>
<p>However; Jesus comes along, and He asks the question, "Do you want to be made whole?"</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">John 5:7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the man's answer. He doesn't say yes, nor does he say no. He doesn't ask how, and he doesn't question the motives of Jesus. He simply acknowledges the truth about his situation, "I cannot save myself and there is no one to help me." Let me ask, are you tired of struggling with sin? Is your answer the answer of the crippled man? Have you given up on yourself yet, or are you still trying to work things out yourself? Jesus is waiting for us to let Him work.</p>
<p>Sister White finishes this story quite well:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>    Jesus does not ask this sufferer to exercise faith in Him. He simply says, “Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.” But the man’s faith takes hold upon that word. Every nerve and muscle thrills with new life, and healthful action comes to his crippled limbs. Without question he sets his will to obey the command of Christ, and all his muscles respond to his will. Springing to his feet, he finds himself an active man.</em></p>
<p>Jesus had given him no assurance of divine help. The man might have stopped to doubt, and lost his one chance of healing. But he believed Christ’s word, and in acting upon it he received strength.</p>
<p>Through the same faith we may receive spiritual healing. By sin we have been severed from the life of God. Our souls are palsied. Of ourselves we are no more capable of living a holy life than was the impotent man capable of walking. There are many who realize their helplessness, and who long for that spiritual life which will bring them into harmony with God; they are vainly striving to obtain it. In despair they cry, “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?” Romans 7:24, margin. Let these desponding, struggling ones look up. The Saviour is bending over the purchase of His blood, saying with inexpressible tenderness and pity, “Wilt thou be made whole?” He bids you arise in health and peace. Do not wait to feel that you are made whole. Believe His word, and it will be fulfilled. Put your will on the side of Christ. Will to serve Him, and in acting upon His word you will receive strength. Whatever may be the evil practice, the master passion which through long indulgence binds both soul and body, Christ is able and longs to deliver. He will impart life to the soul that is “dead in trespasses.” Ephesians 2:1. He will set free the captive that is held by weakness and misfortune and the chains of sin.</p>

<p>Too often, when Jesus comes to ask the question, we respond with the wrong answer. Many times, we are like Jacob, and when conviction comes to the heart, we see it as an enemy. We think our guilt to be something bad that we need to run away from, or something to cover up. In actuality, when we are being convicted about sin, it is the Holy Spirit relaying a message from Jesus, "Do you want to be made whole?" He is not come to condemn us, but to set us free from the sin that He's bringing to our attention! He is commanding us to overcome whatever it is, and when we act on His command to do His will, He enables us with the power to do it! In this way, whenever He convicts us of sin, He is offering us victory over that sin!</p>
<p>If we thus align our will with His every time, we cannot fail. We may follow Him, like Abraham, step by step to righteousness. We may follow Him to the cross and die ourselves, being recreated into the image of God once again. This is salvation, and it's entirely the work of God!</p>
<p>Ye are bought with a price. Christ's blood has purchased you back from the cruel slave master of self and Satan. You are a bought and paid for slave for Christ, a slave to righteousness. Instead of yielding to "I know I shouldn't, but...", yield yourself to obey God, and the devil will flee from you. Submit yourself to Him and cast your burdens on Him.</p>
<p>Give yourself to God and let Him make a new vessel out of you. Let Him fit you for heaven that you may have life eternal.</p>
