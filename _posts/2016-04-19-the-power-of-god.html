<blockquote><em><br />
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation for everyone who believes, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Romans 1:16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you know that when you chew your food meticulously, you actually get more out of it? For instance, when you eat fruit, something like 33% of the nutrients from that fruit is available to the bloodstream. However; when you blend that same fruit into a smoothie, suddenly 90% of the nutrients in that fruit is available to the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Does that mean we should blend all our food? No, not at all, and I recommend against that. If you chew slower and longer, you will get the same effect with the added benefit of mixing the saliva with the food which creates other nutrients. That's what were going to do with this verse, and that's what I hope you do you when you read the Bible by yourself.</p>
<p>Notice the parts with me:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
[For I] [am not ashamed of] [the gospel of Christ] [for it is the power of God] [unto salvation] [for everyone who believes] ...<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Romans 1:16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We see the subject, Paul, who is not ashamed of what? The gospel. And what is the gospel? It is the power of God. And to what application? Salvation. For whom? All who believe.</p>
<p>Ever wanted a Bible definition of what the gospel is? Paul just gave us an explicit definition. <strong>The gospel of Christ is the power of God.</strong> He goes on to say...</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, "The just shall live by faith."<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Romans 1:17</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therein, that is, in the gospel, which is the power of God, is revealed the righteousness of God. The righteousness of God is in the power of God. Since the gospel of Christ is the power of God, and the power of God reveals the righteousness of God, naturally, we must ask, "Well, what is the power of God?"</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Genesis 1:3</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.<br />
For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Psalm 33:6,9</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
And as [Jesus] was still coming, the demon threw [the boy] down and convulsed him. Then Jesus <strong>rebuked</strong> the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father. And they were amazed at the mighty power of God.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Luke 9:42-43</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put it simply, the power of God is the creative power of His word. God's word is not like our word. When we say something that is not true, it's a lie. However; God cannot lie, because the moment He says something, it comes to pass. He "calls those things which do not exist as though they did." (Rom 4:17).</p>
<p>Every word of God, the very scriptures we have in our hands, is imbued with this power. When we read "Let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus," we should instantly recognize this phrase as being similar to "Let there be light." God is not speaking as we do, giving us something to strive toward, but He is speaking the very thing into us. By faith, we hear the word, and we say like Mary "let it be unto me according to thy word." (Luke 1:38). Thus, God in that moment creates the very thing His word says in us!</p>
<p>The ten commandments follow the same principle. They are not a set of guidelines which we hear and then proceed to try and do in our own strength. Rather, God is, by speaking them to us, creating the very thing He has spoken. He says to us, "Thou shalt not kill." We, by faith, can have a relationship with the word of God like that of David:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
"Now, O LORD God, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, establish it forever and do as You have said. ... For You, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed this to Your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house.' Therefore Your servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer to You.<br />
And now, O LORD God, You are God, and Your words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant, that it may continue before You forever; for You, O LORD God, have spoken it, and with Your blessing let the house of Your servant be blessed forever."<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">2 Samuel 7:25,27-29</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David's faith was in the power of God's word. God spake, and thus, David's only prayer was much like Mary's: "Let it be unto me according to thy word." He simply thanked God and accepted what God said. He saw in God's commandments not rules being laid down, but promises with guaranteed fulfillment.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>So shall my word be that goes forth from My mouth;<br />
It shall not return to Me void,<br />
But it shall accomplish what I please,<br />
And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Isaiah 55:11</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David "found it in his heart" to pray his prayer because God had spoken it. David depended upon the word of God to fulfil what it said, because His faith was in the power of God, not in his ability to accomplish what God spoke.</p>
<p>This is much like Abraham, who learned to depend solely upon the word to accomplish what it said. God had said there would be a child of the promise, yet Abraham a number of times attempted to fulfill this promise himself. However; Abraham learned to depend upon the word to fulfill what the word says, and we see this manifested in his crowning trial concerning the sacrifice of Isaac. Abraham had two words from God: "in Isaac shall thy seed be called." and "Take now your only son Isaac ... and offer him as a burnt offering."</p>
<p>Abraham could have stopped to question the seemingly conflicting statements made by God. However; He didn't do this, because He saw no contradiction. Abraham believed that Isaac was the promised child, and Abraham believed that even if he were to sacrifice Isaac, the word of God would still fulfill the promise of making his seed as the dust of the earth or the stars of heaven. How?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,<br />
Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:<br />
Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead...</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Hebrews 11:17-19</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God speaks, and it stands fast. His word cannot be broken. He says it and it comes to pass in that moment. Do you need to do anything more to help God's word accomplish what it says? No, you don't. By faith, accept it, and walk accordingly resting in the power of God.</p>
<p>Every call of God, every commandment, even "Be ye therefor perfect", is backed by creative power. God is working to restore us back to perfect harmony with His will, and God's will for us is a "new creation wherein dwelleth righteousness." Thus, when one has faith in the word of God, believing that what God says comes to pass because He says so, we may rest assured in full acceptance of that word's fulfillment and say the prayer of David and Mary.</p>
<p>You see, Jesus lived by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. This doesn't mean that He, in his own strength, kept every requirement of God. It means that he allowed God to work in Him and through Him and believed in the power of the word to accomplish what it says. Literally, He was alive because of the word of God, and it is the same for you and me. If we reject the word of God; there is no life outside of it!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.<br />
And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Ezekiel 36:26-27</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Ephesians 5:18</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you see? These are precious promises! Lord, fill me with thy Spirit according to thy word! I believe, help mine unbelief!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,<br />
To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Jude 1:24-25</p>
