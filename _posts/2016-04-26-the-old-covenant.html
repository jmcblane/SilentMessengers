<blockquote>
<em>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.<br />
Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.<br />
For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Romans 6:12-14</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
The scripture tells us plainly that "sin is the transgression of the law." Our leading scripture tells us that "sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace." To say that another way, "you shall not be given to breaking the law of God, because you're not under the law, but under grace."</p>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
This concept of not breaking the law of God while not being under the law of God is something that needs to be reconciled. I want to bring out a few key features of what happened at Sinai, the confusion that took place, what the new covenant is about, and my prayer is that these things will shed some light on darkness prevailing in our day.</p>
<p>So what is the Old Covenant?</p>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
I think it's safe to conclude that we agree, the Old Covenant concerns the events of Mt. Sinai. Indeed, at that mountain, God established the Old Covenant with the nation of Israel who had recently been taken from Egypt. God, by His mighty power, had done many marvellous miracles along the way to teach them to trust in the power of His word. And why do I say these were to bring the Israelites into dependence upon God's word? Well what's on of the very first things we learn about God in the scriptures?</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em><br />
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Genesis 1:3</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
<em><br />
For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Psalm 33:9</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
<em><br />
The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: <strong>but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.</strong><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Matthew 8:8</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
God speaks. This is how He creates. This is how He performs His mighty works. Indeed, it is the very word of God that upholds all things. Heb 1:3. The creative power in God's word is one of the most basic and oft forgotten things of God.</p>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
It is by this word that God wrought the miracles before the Israelites, and understanding the creative power of God's word, they were intended to grow in faith through all of these signs and wonders; faith that depends upon the word of God to do the thing it says.</p>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
This takes us to Sinai. After all of these things, and knowing this, God spake to the Israelites from the mountain the words of the ten commandments. However; what is the one thing they forgot? The very first thing we learn about God in the Bible!</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em><br />
Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and <strong>we will hear it, and do it.</strong><br />
And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.<br />
<strong>O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!</strong><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Deuteronomy 5:27-29</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
The Israelites said "we will do it." God had not asked them to fulfil His word. God's word fulfils itself. In faith, trust and reliance upon the power of God's word, the Israelites were to hear the ten commandments spoken and let the power of God write them upon their heart. God's word was to create the righteousness of the law within them by the hearing of faith.</p>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
We do not have righteousness in us. We are without form, and void. Darkness is upon our faces from birth. The Spirit of God hovers over us, watching and waiting in eager anticipation. God speaks, and by the hearing of faith, it is fulfilled in us. God says 'Let there be light,' and our eyes are wide open. God says, 'Thou shalt not kill,' and murder disappears from our hearts.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em><br />
For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Hebrews 4:2</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
The context of this verse is that it is speaking about those Israelites who were at Mt. Sinai. What was the problem? They lacked faith. This is why the Old Covenant happened. God never intended for them to agree to do what He said. They were supposed to recognize that God was trying to create a clean heart in them by the power of His word, but they didn't believe in the power of God, and therefor they said '<strong>we will do it</strong>.' They set out to fulfil the word of God themselves.</p>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
Romans 13:10 tells us that "love is the fulfilling of the law," and we learn in 1 John 4:8 that "God is love." It is only God who can fulfil the perfect righteousness of the law. Human beings, devoid of righteousness, cannot produce righteousness which they do not have. The law of God is the foundation of His government. The perfect righteousness of God is the requirement for eternal life. Anything in transgression of the law of God is sin, and sin is not allowed in eternity.</p>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
How can we ever hope to achieve such an impossibly high standard? We've all broken the law of God, every one of us. We are all sentenced to death. "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord." Romans 7:25. "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God."</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em><br />
A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.<br />
And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
The Old Covenant was Israel's promise to do the law of God. The New Covenant is God's promise to do the law in us. The entire process of things is reversed. Israel intended to keep God's law, but God intends to recreate us into law keeping creatures by faith. Notice: The one thing that doesn't change here is the law.</p>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
Looking back on their experience we learn a very important lesson about salvation. The way of salvation is by believing in the power of God's word to do the thing it says. It is by having the faith of Jesus Christ. God raised Jesus from the dead by the power of this word, and He can raise us from spiritual death by the same power. When we read the ten commandments in faith, understanding that they are not requests for us to fulfil, then we may see the awesome righteousness of God:</p>
<p><strong>God does not require anything from us that He is not willing to impart to us.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Romans 10:3</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
He requires us to keep His law, this is true. However; God's word is able to impart to us the very power to do so. He can do it in us and through us. This is the only way it can be done, and this only by Jesus Christ. It is by His commandment which says "Thou shalt not kill" that we do not kill. It is by His commandment "Thou shalt not commit adultery" that we may obtain the grace to flee licentiousness. This word is spoken to <strong>you</strong>. This word has the power, if you believe, to fulfil the very thing it says <strong>in you</strong>. Believe God, who said you will not kill, and you will not kill because He said so. His word is sure.</p>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
The hearing of faith writes the law of God on the heart. God creates within us, by speaking it to us, the very righteousness which is required of us. He puts His righteousness inside of us where there was no righteousness, and <strong>creates</strong> in us a clean heart that obeys the law of God. In this way, salvation is by grace through faith, a free gift of God to any who will have it. Disobedience is ever only unbelief, because if we believed, the very power of God which upholds the world would uphold us also.</p>
<p style="text-indent:36px;">
Many are in bondage to this day, trying to do for God what God longs to do for them. The death of the Lawgiver, the blood of the covenant, has freed us from the curse of the law - that is, the agreement to fulfil God's word ourselves. We may be married to Christ, who died for us, took our sins upon Himself, and bridged heaven and earth that we may have access to the power of God to create righteousness within us where there is none. Christ has opened the doors of heaven that God's grace may be poured out upon us, and we may obtain the very righteousness that God requires of us. God will impart it to us, as a free gift, through faith. Only believe and put your whole trust in the word of God!</p>
<p>To be continued...</p>
