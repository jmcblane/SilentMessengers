<blockquote>"For my thoughts are not your thoughts,<br />
neither are your ways my ways," say the LORD.<br />
"For as the heavens are higher than the earth,<br />
so are my ways higher than your ways,<br />
and my thoughts than your thoughts."</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Isaiah 55:8-9</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">God's thoughts are far above our thoughts. His word is infinite in breadth, for God is infinite in breadth. His commandments are exceeding broad, says the Psalmist. Psalm 119:96. God's word is eternal, and His word spoken from the beginning carries throughout all of time. God said "Let there be light," and there is light, from that word that was spoken back then. His word is ever relevant at any given point in history.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So what is the lesson here? Namely, we cannot comprehend infinity. We have a finite mind. It is impossible for us to grasp beyond a mere fraction of the depth of any part of the word of God. God said "Thou shalt not commit adultery," and Jesus takes it further to explain that even looking upon a woman to lust after her is transgressing that commandment. We cannot comprehend the infinite breadth to which the law of God spans. Indeed, the law of God demands perfect righteousness, and how do we know that? Simple. Only one person has ever satisfied the demands of that law without transgressing it a single time: and that Person is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This makes one thing painfully obvious. If we cannot ever hope to grasp the infinite scope of God's commandments, and the law of God demands perfect righteousness, how can we ever hope to attain to the righteousness that the law requires? We cannot even comprehend it, so how is it possible that man should ever be able to fulfil it? "With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible." Mark 10:27.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The answer lies in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ came to this world as a man; a living demonstration of perfect obedience to the law of God in fallen man. He demonstrated that it is possible for man to achieve perfect righteousness; the perfect righteousness required by the law of God. He showed that it is possible for fallen man to live without sinning, and moreover, He has provided a propitiation for our failures to do so. Jesus was made "like unto His brethren," and was "in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin." Heb 2:17, 4:15. He had no advantage over us, yet He overcame without failure. Perfect success. Flawless victory.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">How then, you might ask, did Jesus accomplish such a feat? It's a good question, and it's one we desperately need the answer to if we wish for a shot at eternal life - which is the inheritance of the saints, after all, is it not? So then, how was it that Jesus obtained the inheritance that was promised to Abraham?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">For the promise that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Romans 4:13</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">The seed is Christ. Gal 3:16. This means that Jesus did not earn the inheritance by perfect obedience to the law of God. Let that sink in. It was not something He bought by His works, or by His merit. It wasn't something He obtained because He had access to something we do not have. In fact, He had the same finite mind that we have. It was impossible that the finite mind of Jesus Christ would be able to grasp the infinite breadth of the commandments of God.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Jesus obtained the inheritance by faith, and so can we. Jesus' righteousness was completely and totally by faith. The word of God worked in Him and through Him to create the righteousness which is not present in fallen humanity; the righteousness that fallen humanity cannot comprehend. The Father was in Jesus Christ, upholding Him from falling. Jesus Christ wants to be in you, and He wants to uphold you from falling by the same power which was able to keep Him from falling.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Truly, He is able. Truly, He will do it in you, and why? Simple. You cannot do it yourself. You have this great need of righteousness, for which on your own you have absolutely zero hope of attaining, no matter how perfectly you obey what you understand of the law of God. The only possible way that you could ever achieve perfect obedience to the law of God is by God working it in you and through you. Your job? To learn to depend upon the Word of God, Jesus Christ, our righteousness, to come into your heart and create in you that which you so desperately need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Philippians 2:13</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">God speaks, and it comes to pass. Gen 1:3, Psalm 33:9. God's commandments are not burdensome. 1 John 5:3. The very commandment itself contains the power to fulfil it's demand in you, for you. Isa 55:10-11. The fact that He said it provides the very means of its fulfilment. It is by faith that you may accept the working of His commandment in your heart and be uplifted to the righteousness of Christ; Christ in you, and you in Christ. Col 1:27-29. Christ working in you that which you cannot hope to do for yourself, and you resting in Christ, a new creature, in which faith works by love to manifest the perfect righteousness of Christ. Gal 5:6, 6:15, 1 Cor 7:19.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>1 John 5:4</strong></p>
