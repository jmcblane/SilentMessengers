<blockquote><em>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Romans 5:1-2</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been studying the word "grace," and I would simply like to share a thought I had this morning from my time in Romans 5.</p>
<p>God is infinite. This means that God's thoughts are infinite, and at any given time God has infinite thoughts at that time. Every single one of those thoughts is directed toward the single purpose of the salvation of His children, creatures, and creation. It is the only thing on God's infinite mind: saving you. God pours Himself out for us, as displayed best on the cross, in that He withholds none of Himself from us. He is working with every minutia of His being for your salvation and mine. God cannot fail to save us; we can only fail to be saved.</p>
<p>This is the grace of God wherein we stand. The power of God, infinite grace, working only to save us from ourselves. He loves us more than life itself, and He has wagered His own life on the successful completion of restoration; the fulfillment of the promise. If God failed, He would cease to exist, and with Him all things.</p>
<p>But God cannot fail. His word is sure.</p>
