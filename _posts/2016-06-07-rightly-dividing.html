<blockquote>Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
<p> <strong>2 Timothy 2:15</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The meaning of this verse flashed into my mind for the first time the other night, and I would like to share.</p>
<p>I believe what it means to rightly divide the word refers to portions on a plate. Let me explain:</p>
<p>Say you are serving a baby, an adult, and an elderly person without teeth. Do you give the baby half a loaf of bread? What about feeding the adult just one bottle of milk? What if we give poor grandmother a thick, well done steak?</p>
<p>Thus, we see that not only what we feed someone is important, but also how much we give them. It is the same with the bread of life. Baby Christians need milk, and mature Christians can't survive on milk alone. We are called to serve each one accordingly with discretion, being "wise, redeeming the time, for the days are evil." Eph 5:16.</p>
<p>Some folks just aren't there, yet. Some folks need the bottle and nurturing. "And of some have compassion, making a difference: and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire: hating even the garment spotted by the flesh." A loving rebuke is not done with witticism, nor is it well done with a plain, open, and cutting statement in public. Even a loving rebuke in public can be a bad thing, simply because the young nearby are being force fed the meat which you are giving the adult.</p>
<p>I encourage taking some time to consider Isaiah 28:23-29 as well. It presents another way of thinking about the same idea.</p>
<p>Fun fact: the word for "dividing" denotes making many parallel, straight cuts; just like you would slice up a load of bread. How fitting!</p>
