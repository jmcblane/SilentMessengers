<blockquote><p>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but from God: the powers that are, are ordained by God. Whoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves condemnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same: For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou doest that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. Therefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. For for this cause ye pay tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.<br />
<b>Romans 13:1-7</b></p></blockquote>
<p><b><br />

<p>There is certainly quite a lot of information to digest here. Let's start from the top.</p>
<p>"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers." Quite frankly, God is calling us to obey earthly governments. Why? "...for there is no power but of God. The powers that be are ordained of God." God has ordained the presidents, judges, cops, and whatever else you think of when you think government. It is He who sets up and tears down kings, principalities, and powers. See Dan 2:21 and Prov 8:15-16.</p>
<p>Chewing on this verse produces the next verse. When we understand that God has ordained the powers that be, and God has called us to obey them, it becomes painfully obvious that "Whosoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God." This means, quite frankly, that breaking the laws and ordinances in your present locality is transgressing the commandment of God, which is sin. Lawlessness, therefore, of any nature - even towards man's laws - is not acceptable.</p>
<p>So then, in so doing the work of God, if we transgress the laws of man in order to "further the gospel," are we really furthering the gospel? Are we not rather misrepresenting the character of God, transgressing His law, and setting a bad example for those whom we think we are helping? Rom 3:8 points to the concept of doing "evil so that good may come" and says that those who think as such; well, their "damnation is just."</p>
<p>So why then should we be subject to the laws and governments? Is it for the sake of living peacably among men? Or, perhaps rather, is it for our own sake, that we may not suffer as much in this life? I would say probably yes, to both of these, but check this out:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.<br />
<b>Romans 13:5</b></p></blockquote>
<p>I'll admit, it took a bit of prayerful thinking to grasp what this means. First of all, plainly stated, is the fact that we <b>need</b>&nbsp;to be subject to the laws of man, as well as the laws of God. It's not optional, or a bonus. It's a necessity; required for our well being. It's not just that it's a good idea, or that it's profitable, or even that it promotes peace. No, rather, we <b>need</b>&nbsp;it for conscience sake, he says. Well what does that mean?</p>
<p>Imagine: you go around breaking the laws of the land. Everything is going fine until you get stopped by a police officer, caught in the act, under the eye of judgment, and you are sentenced guilty. Now you are suffering for what you have done. Do you have any right to say that you suffered unjustly? No, you cannot say that. You own conscience condemns you. Without a clean conscience, you cannot suffer joyfully, nor can you suffer for righteousness' sake. You are suffering for your own lawlessness, and there is nothing righteous about that. It's perfectly just, and God is a God of justice. You are reaping the fruit of your own doings.</p>
<p>Thus, if we ever expect to have a clean conscience, we must be subject to the authorities. That way, when we suffer unjustly, we may say that we have suffered for Christ's sake, and our suffering will not be in vain. Our unjust oppression will cry out to God, who will deliver us from the hand of the oppressor. God has something to say about injustice and those who suffer for righteousness' sake. However; to bail you out of every instance where you willingly decided you were above the law? That's just bad parenting, plain and simple.</p>
<blockquote><p>"And herein do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men."</p>
<p><b>Acts 24:16</b></p></blockquote>
<p>And here, again, we see the same virtue: a clean conscience toward both God and man. The two statements Jesus gave to sum up the law echo this sentiment, love toward God and love toward our fellow man. The golden rule, do unto others as we would have them do unto us, says likewise. Would you prefer that someone cooperate with your requests in your home or disregard everything? Would you like it if the whole neighborhood made a treaty not to shoot guns in the area, and everyone went about shooting cans out of their trees toward your home? If we do not respect one another's wishes, we cannot say that we love one another.</p>
<blockquote><p>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme; Or to governors, as to them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.<br />
<b>1 Peter 2:13-17</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Here is the same sentiment: "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man..." I ask again, why? "For the Lord's sake." "For so is the will of God..." It is the will of God that we "Honor all men," and it is for His sake that we do this. For what purpose does our honoring all men benefit the Lord? In what way is He glorified by it? Well, in many. God rains down His mercy on the just and the unjust. He is no respecter of persons, and He is willing that none should perish. God loves all of us. We are representatives of Him. People look to us, examine the fruits of our lives, and by this they judge the God we serve. Our example is a living testimony, a visual sermon, about who God is and directly affects how people think about Him. If we are lawless, we are not reflecting His will, nor His character. We are rather, by our bad example, bearing false witness concerning Him who we profess to follow.</p>
<p>Another point I find here is that "with well doing ye may silence the ignorance of foolish men..." Think about it. Say, for instance, you are selling good, wholesome, religious books in the area to bring people closer to the Lord. The community you are in has a "No Soliciting" policy and huge signs posted up. The second house you come to has someone who immediately gets angry, calls the police, spits on you, and watches you get handcuffed and taken away. The fact that you, a servant of the Lord, were in the wrong, gives that man plenty of ammunition to rail accusations all day long if he wants to. His ignorance, not knowing that you were serving the Lord in your work, becomes loud and boisterous, arrogant, and dare I say justified. He exalts over the fact that he had the privilege to put away some lawless person who was not adhering to the law. This is to your shame.</p>
<p>However; if in that same circumstance, there wasn't a no soliciting policy, the man has nothing wherewith to boast. The officer comes, informs him that he is wrong, and suddenly all he has is his ignorance. Even moreso, if you are wrongfully arrested, you suffer for Christ's sake knowing that you did nothing wrong and your reward is in heaven.</p>
<blockquote><p>For this is thanksworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, that is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously...</p>
<p><b>1 Peter 2:19-23</b></p>
<p>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye, and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled: but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: having a good conscience, that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evil-doers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing.</p>
<p><b>1 Peter 3:13-17</b></p></blockquote>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>There is only one time that it is ever acceptable to transgress the laws of man, and that's when they directly contradict the law of God. If an authority over you orders you to kill someone, you cannot in good conscience toward God execute this command, and thus you have to make a decision between God and man. That said, "We ought to obey God rather than man." Acts 5:29. Jesus makes this point pretty distinct when discussing whether or not to pay taxes to Caesar, and I don't think I have to elaborate too much upon it. The principle is very straightforward.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to share some from the book Patriarchs and Prophets that brought out quite a bit for me to think about concerning this issue. It shed much light on the subject, and put many of these principles in play. The chapter, David's Sin and Repentance, discusses the infamous incident in which David kills Uriah and takes his wife.</p>
<blockquote><p>Heretofore David's record as a ruler had been such as few monarchs have ever equaled. It is written of him that he "executed judgment and justice unto all his people." 2 Sam 8:15. His integrity had won the confidence and fealty of the nation. But as he departed from God and yielded himself to the wicked one, he became for the time the agent of Satan; yet he still held the position and authority that God had given him, and because of this, claimed obedience that would imperil the soul of him who should yield it. And Joab, whose allegience had been given to the king rather than to God, transgressed God's law because the king commanded it.</p>
<p>David's power had been given him by God, but to be exercised only in harmony with the divine law. When he commanded that which was contrary to God's law, it became sin to obey. "The powers that be are ordained of God." Romans 13:1. but we are not to obey them contrary to God's law. The apostle Paul, writing to the Corinthians, sets forth the principle by which we should be governed. He says, "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ." 1 Cor 11:1. ...</p>
<p>From the beginning Satan has portrayed to men the gains to be won by transgression. Thus, he seduced angels. Thus he tempted Adam and Eve to sin. And thus he is still leading multitides away from obedience to God. The path of transgression is made to appear desirable: "but the end thereof are the ways of death." Proverbs 14:12. Happy are they who, having ventured in this way, learn how bitter are the fruits of sin, and turn from it betimes. God in His mercy did not leave David to be lured to utter ruin by the deceitful rewards of sin.</p>
<p>For the sake of Israel also there was a necessity for God to interpose. As time passed on, David's sin toward Bathsheba became known, and suspicion was excited that he had planned the death of Uriah. The Lord was dishonored. He had gavored and exalted David, and David's sin misreprersented the character of God and cast reproach upon His name. It tended to lower the standard of godliness in Israel, to lesson in many minds the aborrence of sin: while those who did not love and fear God were by it emboldened in transgression.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's beautiful how all of these principles found in the New Testament are illustrated so perfectly, all at once, in but one small story of the Old Testament. I find this ever to be the case, and never cease to be awed. I highly recommend reading the rest of this chapter (and book!).</p>
<p>Simply stated, then: we have a responsibility as children of God to have respect unto each other, not just for our sake, but for God's sake. The influence of our actions has consequences beyond what we can even fathom. It is not safe for us to decide ourselves what is right and what is wrong. The only safe path is to decide based on the word of God, which has declared us under the authority of principalities and power, lest they contradict the word of God.</p>
<p>However; the trend in legislation these days is tending towards the restriction of this liberty of conscience, and even taking a turn for directly standing in opposition to the law of God. In the time when laws are passed which put us in a Mt. Carmel situation, always, always, choose the word of God, no matter what the cost. Let us always keep Him first and foremost, and the rest will fall into place. We will give unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and give unto God what is God's, to the glory of God.</p>
