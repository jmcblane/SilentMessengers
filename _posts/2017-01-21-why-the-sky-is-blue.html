<p>â€‹Are you familiar with the idea that the ten commandments were written on tablets of sapphire? This comes from a reasonable line of thinking that starts with the passage from Exodus:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size:16px;">They saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was like a paved work of sapphire stone, like the skies for clearness. Yahweh said to Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain, and stay here, and I will give you the tables of stone with the law and the commands that I have written, that you may teach them."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b style="font-size:13.6px;">Exodus 24:10,12 WEB</b></p></blockquote>
<p>In the more literal rendering, the text says "I will give you <em>the</em> tablets of stone," as is rendered in this translation. The insinuation is that the tablets were both fashioned and written upon by God, and taken from the very stone beneath His feet. We see further evidence of this by comparing visions of His throne with the figure that represented it on earth: the ark of the covenant, in which is contained the ten commandments in stone (Deut 10:5).</p>
<blockquote><p>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Ezekiel 1:26</b></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Ezekiel 10:1</b></p></blockquote>
<p>A throne of sapphire. The seat of God's government is His law veiled within the temple that represents Christ, the living Stone, upon whose heart is written God's law, who is the temple of the loving God. We see plainly that this lines up with other portions of scripture that declare:</p>
<blockquote><p>And God called the firmament Heaven.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b style="font-size:16px;">Genesis 1:8a</b></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Isaiah 66:1a</b></p></blockquote>
<p>So, the heaven is God's throne. In vision, God's throne is seen to be in the likeness of sapphire. When Moses and company see God, beneath Him is sapphire stone. In the ark, beneath God, in His throne... Would there not be sapphire? That is, two sapphire tablets wherein is written the commandments of God?</p>
<p>We see then that it makes sense why the color blue, in the Hebrew mind, was to remind them of the law (as it should us spiritual Jews):</p>
<blockquote><p>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a cord of blue: And it shall be to you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them: and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Numbers 15:37-39</b></p></blockquote>
<p>So, blue is the color of the commandments of God. Heaven is the throne of God: heaven being the firmament.</p>
<p><b><i>Why is the sky blue?&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p>It is to be, to us, a constant reminder of the commandments of God, the seat of His authority. We are to always remember that we, down here, are ever under God's law: we are ever under His authority. The heavens declare the glory of God (Psalm 19:1), which is His name and character (Exodus 33-34): that character being etched out in sapphire stone and lived out in the life of Christ.</p>
<p>The sky reminds us of the high standard which Christ fulfilled and is seeking to fulfill in each and every one of us if we will only believe. It is lofty and ever out of reach: but Christ is the ladder which bridges heaven and earth. He is the way by which we may reach the sky. He will lift us up.</p>
<p>What a beautiful message from a glorious God. What a beautiful truth painted in the book of nature. Praise Him!</p>
