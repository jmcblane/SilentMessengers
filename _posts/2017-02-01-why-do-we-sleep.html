<p>I was laying in bed in prayer on my way to slumber, when the question occurred to me: What spiritual lesson do we find in sleep? God is not arbitrary and in every aspect of creation He has illustrated the truths of the gospel. Though this world is marred by sin, yet still light shines amidst the darkness and we may see glimpses of His wisdom everywhere.</p>
<p>So I asked the question, what truth does sleep hold? Like a flood, the answer (at least, <em>an</em> answer) came rushing through my mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</em><br />
<strong>Romans 6:11</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">Let's take this piece by piece.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The first step is to look at sleep and what it represents in the scripture. Over and over again sleep is compared to death. "...lest I sleep the sleep of death.", "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed...", "And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake...", "...we who are alive and remain shall by no means precede those who are asleep... the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we shall be caught up together with them..." (Psalm 13:3; 1 Corinthians 15:51; Daniel 12:2; 1 Thess 4:15-16).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Jesus, while on earth, made this parallel Himself with Lazarus:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span id="en-NKJV-26535" class="text John-11-11">...[Jesus] said to [His disciples], <span class="woj">“Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.”</span></span><span id="en-NKJV-26535" class="text John-11-11"><span class="woj"><br />
</span></span><span id="en-NKJV-26536" class="text John-11-12">Then His disciples said, “Lord, if he sleeps he will get well.”<br />
</span><span id="en-NKJV-26537" class="text John-11-13">However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.<br />
</span></em><span id="en-NKJV-26538" class="text John-11-14"><em>Then Jesus said to them plainly, </em><span class="woj"><em>“Lazarus is dead."</em><br />
<strong>John 11:11-14</strong></span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>So then, in figure, by going to sleep each night we "die daily." Each new day we wake up from death to walk in newness of life. But what are we dying to? And what are we walking in?</p>
<p>Jesus said, back there in John chapter 11, "If any man walks in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world. But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him." Paul exhorts us likewise:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span id="en-NKJV-29627" class="text 1Thess-5-5">You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-29628" class="text 1Thess-5-6">Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-29629" class="text 1Thess-5-7">For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night. </span> </em><span id="en-NKJV-29630" class="text 1Thess-5-8"><em>But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation.</em><br />
<strong>1 Thessalonians 5:5-8</strong><br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p>and again</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light.<br />
</em><strong>Ephesians 5:8</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, we see that proper behavior is sleeping at night and walking in daylight. So what then, is the day? And what of the night? What lessons do we learn from these?</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that the sky is blue? The color blue, Biblically speaking, points us to the law of God - a figure of Christ, the living law. Thus, the blue sky of daytime represents the character of Christ. Walking in the daytime is to walk in Christ. So long as the light is shining from the Sun of Righteousness, we are ever under the beautiful blue banner of righteousness. We can remember always that, though the heavens are beyond our reach, Christ the bridge between heaven and earth enables us to touch the sky.</p>
<p>So what, then, of the night? In the night sky, there is no blue. The blue is quite frankly missing. In the night there is a lack of law - lawlessness - and darkness. The temperature gets colder, the scavengers come out to dig in the trash, and men do things they would not normally do in the broad daylight. Here is wickedness and iniquity represented by a figure that we ought to be familiar with.</p>
<p>So each day we see the gospel repeated in figure by our sleeping pattern. We sleep through the night, demonstrating death to lawlessness and sin. We rise up each morning to walk in the day, in the Spirit, in Christ. We die to the old man of sin and walk in newness of life; not in the darkness of iniquity, but in the massive blue tent of God's law. This is a daily matter! We don't just sleep one time and done, nor do we run on and on through night and day without sleeping. Rather, we quite naturally fall into harmony with the light unless, for some behavior or reason, we choose to go against it. We are built to function with the sunlight in a certain rhythm, and for our own best health we ought to preserve this harmony and avoid anything which would keep it from being so!</p>
<p>Now that you've come this far, go back and read Romans 6:11 again. It fits the concept perfectly.</p>
<p>Isn't God amazing? I'll have to write up a post on the wisdom concerning the stars in the night sky next. There are so many things to share. If the Lord reveals more things like this with you, I would love to hear them! If you have insight to add, comment away. I pray He opens all of our eyes to the wondrous lessons He has written for us in the book of nature.</p>
