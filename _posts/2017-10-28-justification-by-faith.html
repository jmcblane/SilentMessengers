<p>Take a walk with me, will you? This time, let us stroll down Romans 3:19-28 and observe what there is to see. This is one of my favorite passages to travel along, and I do believe that you will find it pleasant yourself. Let us take it, verse by verse, shall we?</p>
<blockquote><p>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</p></blockquote>
<p>The law speaks to those that are under the law. What does the law say, you might ask? Why, the law says "You are guilty." And to whom does the law speak? It speaks to those who are under its dominion.</p>
<p>Here we find that all the world is declared guilty before God. The law speaks to all of us, save Christ, declaring us guilty. What does this mean, then? Quite frankly, it means we are under the law, because the law only speaks to those who are under it. And the law speaks to those that are under it, that it might silence everyone, declaring all to be guilty, and quite frankly deserving of death. (cf. Romans 6:23)</p>
<p>If you ever doubt that you are under the law of God, look up. That beautiful blue sky is an object lesson of the standard that we are held accountable to; blue being the color of the law. (cf. Numbers 15:37-41) For the transgressor, this is frightening; but when we are in Christ, the righteousness of God over us is a wonderful promise. When we walk in the light, we are covered by the righteousness of Christ. If we walk in darkness, there is no righteousness to cover us, yet God has placed lesser lights out there that we might, because of them, desire the greater light. But I digress...</p>
<blockquote><p>Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, that is, for this reason. What reason? It is for the fact that the law declares every man guilty that man cannot be justified by the law.</p>
<p>Let us stop and examine again this word "justified."</p>
<p>To justify simply means "to make just." According to scripture, who are the just? Romans 2:13 tells us that "not the hearers of the law are just in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be justified." The NLT spells it out plainly, saying "merely listening to the law doesn’t make us right with God. It is obeying the law that makes us right in his sight."</p>
<p>So then, to make someone just is to make them a doer of the law. The law cannot make someone a doer of the law. The law itself has no regenerating power. The law merely reveals our sins. It declares us guilty, spelling out the consequences, and offering no pardon or restoration.</p>
<p>And by the deeds of the law, we cannot be justified. In the greater context, this includes the entire Mosaic system of worship. Not by outward obedience to God's commandments, nor by bringing animal sacrifices, nor by all the ceremonies and rituals and songs, can we be made righteous. These deeds, in and of themselves, offer no peace with God. All of this was intended to reveal to us our need of a Savior; it was to reveal our complete and utter helplessness.</p>
<p>We do not have any righteousness within ourselves, and the law plainly declares that. We go to the law, it declares us unrighteous, and we have nothing to offer God in order to resolve this problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe.</p></blockquote>
<p>The law taught righteousness, this is true. However; now we have seen manifest the righteousness that was declared in the law more fully. And how? In the face of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And this righteousness which was manifest in Jesus Christ is witnessed by the Law and the Prophets; that is, they declare that Jesus Christ is perfectly righteous. The scriptures testify that Jesus was holy and blameless. He is the manifestation of perfect righteousness in human flesh, and in Him is revealed fully the standard to which we are held accountable.</p>
<p>And moreso, this righteousness is to be manifest in us. Through faith in Jesus Christ, we may receive the righteousness of God, for it is promised "to all and on all who believe."</p>
<p>And notice the phrase, "to all and on all." This righteousness of God is received by us in two ways. We receive it "onto" ourselves, that is, to cover us. This is the pardoning aspect, by which Christ's righteousness takes the place of ours, and God looks upon us as though we had never sinned. However; first is mentioned "to" us, that is, <em>into</em> us. That righteousness is chiefly received <em>into</em> us, and then <em>upon </em>us.</p>
<p>Through faith, we may receive the righteousness of God within and without, and both of these are a part of being justified. We are forgiven <em>and</em> cleansed of unrighteousness. We receive a new heart, and a new spirit, that delights in the will of God. Henceforth, God looks upon us as though we had never sinned.</p>
<p>And this righteousness is witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, also. They testify that we have been washed and renewed with the Holy Spirit, our eyes having been opened, and our affections being turned toward God in His true character.</p>
<blockquote><p>For there is no difference; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, ...</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone who has ever been born into this world, except Jesus Christ, has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. We are born separated from God, without His Spirit, and rebellious in heart. We are swayed by our corrupt flesh and strong passions. Even those who are born into Christian homes are born with an unregenerate heart in dire need of a new one. As Jesus told Nicodemus, a Pharisee of the strictest order, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."</p>
<p>But praise God for the redemption that is in Christ Jesus! He offers us His grace, and His grace justifies us. To say that again: Jesus died in our place, bearing our guilt, and gives us His Spirit, which makes us righteous before God. By the redemption He offers, we may, by faith, receive the righteousness of God into <em>and</em> upon ourselves. And all this without cost! It is freely given, and cannot be bought or earned. It was purchased by the precious blood of Christ, and to offer anything less than that is an insult; just ask Simon Magus. (cf. Acts 8:14-24)</p>
<p>We don't have to do works of penance to receive pardon. We don't have to do certain works in order to earn God's grace. I say it again, there is no sacrament that you can do in order to gain more of God's grace! It is bestowed without cost through faith in Jesus Christ! Performing the works of the law, even strict obedience to the law of God, can never, ever, purchase for us any part of our salvation. Partaking in sacraments does not aid one bit towards our redemption! Baptism does not having any saving grace to it! There are no magical properties in the water, and there is no grace conferred therein!</p>
<p>Nay, God gives us His Spirit without cost, and He poured out His Son while we were yet sinners. There is nothing we can do but to go to Him and receive it. We can only go to Him and be washed. By His working, we may be pardoned <em>and</em> renewed unto holiness. By His grace, we may "become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust." And through this agency, the righteousness of God is to be manifest in us who believe, and the Law and the Prophets will witness that the righteousness of God indeed has been given unto and upon us through faith. The law will no longer declare us guilty, for we have been declared righteous by Jesus Christ.</p>
<blockquote><p>... whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus Christ's sacrifice on our behalf, and for our transgressions, is a demonstration of the righteousness of God. God did not punish the sins which were committed before Christ. He has not punished our sins now. Jesus Christ bore the punishment for all sin, and in doing so, revealed that God is just. He does not simply allow iniquity to go unchecked.</p>
<p>That said, He does not desire that we should face the consequences of our iniquity; especially in our ignorance. God is willing that we should have a chance to be redeemed of our transgressions. Jesus bore the penalty for sin, and God's wrath is manifested, not towards the unrighteous, but towards unrighteousness itself. God is not in the business of punishing sinners, but eradicating sin. He desires not to destroy us because of our sins, but destroy our sins instead of us.</p>
<p>So then, God has made a way in which He might remain just, and yet forgive and restore sinners to righteousness so that they may be redeemed. He has gotten us out of our sentence which we deserve without committing injustice, that He might make us a holy people unto Himself, preserving our lives for a new creation wherein dwelleth righteousness. We deserve the death penalty, and yet, without being an unjust judge, God has cleared us of the charges if we will accept the redemption that He has offered.</p>
<p>Did I mention that this redemption doesn't cost anything? We can simply go to Him, by faith, and ask for it. He promises to give it, without cost. We may plead the blood of the Savior, and in return God will pour out His grace upon us, making us new creatures in Christ.</p>
<blockquote><p>Where is boasting then?<br />
It is excluded.<br />
By what law? Of works?<br />
No, but by the law of faith.</p>
<p>Therefore, we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law.</p></blockquote>
<p>What have we to boast? "I did all the right works, and said all the right prayers, and because of this I earned God's grace!" "I haven't sinned once in twenty years! God must really love me! I definitely deserve it!"</p>
<p>Nay. But by faith, we recognize ourselves to be unholy, and daily go to God for more of His grace, which is freely bestowed, apart from our works. Our works are a product of what is in our heart, not a means by which we receive new hearts. The man whom God has justified is obedient to the law because that's who He is, for God has made Him that way. His faith takes hold of God's word and clings to it above all feelings or passions.</p>
<p>If we could do something to merit restoration, if we must buy the Holy Spirit or had to earn it through service, then no longer is it fair for everyone. He who has more money gets more salvation. He who was born in the right family with the right opportunities gets in, while the one who couldn't go to the right priest and have the right incantation spoken doesn't get in. Suddenly, it becomes important that we force our friends and family to do the right works, because if they do them they receive grace for it, and we should be diligent to make sure that they receive the grace of Christ. Suddenly, holding your friend at gunpoint and forcing them to be baptized isn't so bad; that is, if baptism itself is a means by which grace is imparted to the soul.</p>
<p>One need only look back to the Dark Ages to see what the bewitching doctrine of righteousness by works creates. The concept that one must be subject to the Pope of Rome, be a member of the church of Rome, and believe that a piece of bread is God in order to be saved, is quite frankly the height of evil. Men were threatened with death if they would not receive the grace of God, and many died because those who killed them believed they were doing God a service by cleansing the world of "unrepentant sinners" and heretics.</p>
<p>Yet, even more insidious, is that which we experience in our daily lives. The enemy comes with the temptation that we must by some means clean ourselves up before we go before God, or the idea that we need not be clean at all. This leads many not to go to Him, thinking they aren't good enough, and it leads others to the opposite extreme, thinking that they're already saved regardless of whether they obey God's law or not.</p>
<p>The truth is simple. The standard is like the sky, unreachable without assistance. Yet, Christ is the ladder that bridges heaven and earth, enabling us to reach the sky. Climbing that ladder takes time, and provision is made for our slip-ups along the way. By faith, we can make it all the way, and we must. We press on with the assurance that what God has promised, He can deliver. He is the one who justifies; He makes us righteous. He gives grace, without cost, day by day as we are able to receive it. He will finish what He has started, and we may continue to climb higher and higher unto the height of Christian perfection.</p>
<p>We may be like Jesus. We must. Press onward and upward. Fight the good fight. Don't look down.</p>
