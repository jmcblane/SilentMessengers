<p>In the scriptures, the terrible condition of leprosy is employed as a symbol of our sinful condition. As one author puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Of all the diseases to which mankind is heir, there is none more loathsome than leprosy. The individual lives for years with this dread disease slowly eating away portions of his body until he longs for death as a release.<br />
From earliest times leprosy has been a type of sin; and a very fitting type it is of that loathsome spiritual disease which destroys the soul of the one who violates his conscience again and again until he has no power to resist, and becomes wholly surrendered to evil.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So then, from the healing of leprosy, we may learn something of the way in which man is cleansed from his iniquity. Grab a copy of Stephen Haskell's<em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cross-Shadow-Stephen-Nelson-Haskell/dp/0828001340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"The Cross and its Shadow</a>" </em>and dig into Chapter 24 for a look at the typology of the ritual for cleansing the leper from Leviticus, from which the above quote is taken.</p>
<p>Here; however, I would like to examine one case of how Jesus gave healing to ten such sick souls, and how this relates to us today.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at Luke 17:11-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="text Luke-17-11">Now it happened as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-25664" class="text Luke-17-12">Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-25665" class="text Luke-17-13">And they lifted up <i>their</i> voices and said, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”</span></p>
<div style="text-align:right;"><strong>Luke 17:11-13</strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>With such a dreadful disease, who wouldn't call out for help? Especially from a Rabbi who was known for curing all sorts of "incurable" maladies. These men had been ostracized for only God knows how long, and here was their only opportunity, as they saw it, to be rid of the very disease which was carrying them speedily to the grave.</p>
<p>And yet, we can be so blind. We realize not that sin is destroying us from the inside out, and God wants to separate us from iniquity, which is destroying us. For many of us, the gospel goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
There is a man who is extremely sick; has been for a few years now. His sickness is unto death. He has oozing, pus-filled sores from head to toe. He has no sensitivity in his limbs, his hair is falling out, and his skin is hanging loosely on his bones. Thus, the man, realizing his condition, finally goes to the Doctor.</p>
<p>The Doctor takes a look at the man and examines him, and pronounces the verdict,</p>
<p>"You have leprosy."</p>
<p>The man bows his head in despair, knowing the end result and the incurable nature of the disease.</p>
<p>However; the Doctor speaks up, "There is hope, friend!"</p>
<p>The man looks to the doctor with a glimmer in his eyes. <em>"Has there been a cure found? Can I be restored? Can I see my family again?"</em> All these thoughts race through his mind as he looks to the Doctor to know what he must do.</p>
<p>The Doctor smiles, looks at the man, and says, "I have just the thing for you, if you can believe." He then reaches into His drawer, shuffles around for a moment, and with a shout of triumph exclaims, "Aha! I've got it!"</p>
<p>He proceeds to excitedly pull out a blindfold from the drawer and place it over His face.</p>
<p>"I don't see anything wrong! You're good to go!" the Doctor says.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you were the man, how would you react? Yet how many of us stop at the forgiveness of God, and neglect so great a salvation as is offered to us? The Great Physician is the <em>healer</em> of all your diseases. He is not the "Great Ignorer of Disease."</p>
<p>So then, let us go back to the passage, and discern something of the way in which the Lord works with us to cure our diseases; both of the body, and of the spirit.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span id="en-NKJV-25666" class="text Luke-17-14">So when He saw <i>them,</i> He said to them, <span class="woj">“Go, show yourselves to the priests.”</span> And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed.</span></p>
<div style="text-align:right;"><strong>Luke 17:14</strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice what Jesus does. He could have waved His hand and made them whole. He could have spoken the word, "Be thou clean!" and they would have been. Yet, how does He deal with us? He gave them a command with which to exercise their will, "Go."</p>
<p>How often do we sit there, waiting for some miracle to come along and fix our problem, when Jesus has given <em>us</em> the command, "Go."? How long have we been waiting for the gospel to go to the world, when Jesus has said to <em>us</em>, "Go."?</p>
<p>Notice the response of the lepers. They don't ask questions. They don't stop to doubt His command. They just simply obey, and what is the result? "<em>...as they went, they were cleansed."<br />
</em></p>
<p>They had no assurance that they would be cleansed. Jesus didn't even mention healing them. He just simply gave them the command, and they did what they were told to do, and in the process of so doing, they received the healing they longed for. They chose to obey His word, and in doing the part that He gave them to do, He did His part in fulfilling His promises to them.</p>
<p>Jesus, like the lepers, gives us His word. He has given us our part to do, spelled out in the scriptures. If we will step out in faith, not questioning, not doubting, and simply will to do that which God has called us to by His word, we will have the healing that we so desire. As we step out to fulfill our part, He will fulfill His. Take a look at this promise:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span id="en-NKJV-1947" class="text Exod-15-26">“If you diligently heed the voice of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God and do what is right in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians. For I <i>am</i> the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> who heals you.”</span></p>
<div style="text-align:right;"><strong>Exodus 15:26</strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Do we believe this? Why then are so many among us sick today? Why do we still suffer the diseases of the Egyptians, both the physical, as well as the worst disease of all: sin? It is because of unbelief, veiled under a profession of faith!</p>
<p><em>We</em> are like whited sepulchres, well dressed lepers with makeup on. The only thing that is keeping us from stepping out into harmony with God's will is ourselves. The only thing keeping us from availing ourselves of so great a salvation that is provided for us is ourselves.</p>
<p>Our physical as well as our spiritual health is tied up with the command, <em>"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you..."</em> How many of us are sick because of our neglect to take part in the work that the Lord has committed unto us? Are you struggling with sin? Are you feeling depressed? Apply this commandment to your life, and see if it doesn't change things. Spend time in the word, discerning where you fall short, and let the grace of God work in you to will and do of His good pleasure. Choose to serve Him, and choose to act on His word. Don't say, "I can't." He promised that He will give you the promised land. You <em>can</em>, by <strong>His</strong> grace, but not if you won't carry His grace into action!</p>
<p>But I digress. Let us have a look at the rest of the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span id="en-NKJV-25667" class="text Luke-17-15">And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God, </span> <span id="en-NKJV-25668" class="text Luke-17-16">and fell down on <i>his</i> face at His feet, giving Him thanks. And he was a Samaritan.</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NKJV-25669" class="text Luke-17-17">So Jesus answered and said, <span class="woj">“Were there not ten cleansed? But where <i>are</i> the nine?</span> </span> <span id="en-NKJV-25670" class="text Luke-17-18"><span class="woj">Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?”</span> </span> <span id="en-NKJV-25671" class="text Luke-17-19">And He said to him, <span class="woj">“Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well.”</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Luke 17:15-19</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting to note that only one of the ten returned to give thanks unto the Lord. How many of us enjoy the benefits of health, yet are ungrateful? What victory has the Lord given, over which we have become unthankful? How often do we get what we want, and we are more content with the gift than the giver?</p>
<p>Nine of those men were only looking for a physical hand-out. One of those men was looking for the healing of the soul. Each received what their heart was longing for.</p>
<p>Do we want to be cleansed of iniquity? We may, and we have seen how. Yet, in applying this principle to our lives, can it be said that we are working for our salvation? What does Jesus say here? <em>"Your faith has made you well."</em></p>
<p>If you read Hebrews chapter 11, in every instance you will find that someone, by faith, <em>did</em> something. By faith, this leper obeyed the word of the Lord, and he was healed. The grace of God wrought out the healing, and it was entirely the gift of God. He did not earn it by His obedience; but obedience was required. He had to carry out the word in his actions <em>before</em> he received any benefit from it. Even so, without faith, it is impossible to please Him. If we don't believe His word, we won't follow it. If we aren't following His word, do we believe it?</p>
<p>This is why our brother James tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="text Jas-1-21">Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. </span><span id="en-NKJV-30289" class="text Jas-1-22">But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>James 1:21-22</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus is our perfect example of living "by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." The word of God is the seed, and the word of the Lord is spirit. The fruits of that seed, of that spirit, when planted in the soil and cultivated, are "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control," and "against such there is no law." The law stands against unrighteousness, and if there be no unrighteousness in us, the law cannot stand against us either. Let us receive the righteousness of Christ, into us and upon us, which washes us clean and covers our transgressions.</p>
<p>It is a high calling; a high standard. Fight the good fight of faith. Don't lower your standard; don't set up an idol for yourself. Look to Jesus, who is the author and finisher of our faith. Let us do our part, and He is faithful to do His.</p>
