<p>God is no respecter of persons. The way in which the Lord deals with one is the way in which He deals with us all. We are told, concerning the Israelites who were led out of Egypt,</p>
<blockquote><p>Moreover, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware that all our fathers were under the cloud, all passed through the sea, all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ. But with most of them God was not well pleased, for their bodies were scattered in the wilderness. ...<br />
<strong>Now, all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for <em>our</em> admonition, upon whom the end of the world has come.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>1 Corinthians 10:1-5,11</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history of the children of Israel is an object lesson for us. In this instance, what is particularly mentioned is their wilderness sojourn. Psalm 106 gives us a broad overview of that sojourn from a wide perspective, and in so doing, teaches us concerning the way of salvation.</p>
<p>Are you up for another walk? I hope so! Let's get started, shall we?</p>
<blockquote><p>Praise the Lord!</p>
<p>Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good!<br />
For His mercy endures forever.</p>
<p>Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord?<br />
Who can declare all His praise?<br />
BLessed are those who keep justice,<br />
And he who does righteousness at all times!</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Psalm 106:1-3</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We open up with a praise, and a declaration. God is good! He is merciful! He has done great things. Moreover, the standard to which we all aspire is declared: Blessed is he who does righteousness at all times!</p>
<p>But we all have fallen short of the glory of God, and we are all looking up to that standard, lofty, and high above our heads. This Psalm is not for the one who has never fallen. It is for you and me; sinners in need of salvation. For the Psalm continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember me, O Lord, with the favor You have toward Your people.<br />
Oh, visit me with Your salvation,<br />
That I may see the benefit of Your chosen ones,<br />
That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation,<br />
That I may glory with Your inheritance.</p>
<p>We have sinned with our fathers,<br />
We have committed iniquity,<br />
We have done wickedly.<br />
Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders;<br />
They did not remember the multitude of Your mecies,<br />
But rebelled by the sea-- the Red Sea.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Psalm 106:4-7</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, David asks to be remembered with the favor that was shown toward Israel. They were an example of God's grace in action, as we shall see, and as David was rehearsing. We, like they, have all rebelled. We have been stubborn and obstinate, and we have sought our own way.</p>
<p>The first example shown here is the rebellion by the Red Sea. God had miraculously delivered the Israelites from Egypt, sending them a savior in Moses, and promising to take them to a land fairer than day. They saw His mighty hand in the plagues, and they saw Pharoah humbled in that dreadful night of the Passover. They saw as Egyptians poured goods into their hands as they were leaving town. After that, they were led by a pillar of fire by night, and a cloud by day. God was manifesting His presence to them in astounding ways, with them every step of the way.</p>
<p>Yet, even still, when Pharoah corners them at the Red Sea, their faith is less than little:</p>
<blockquote><p>And when Pharoah drew near, the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord. Then they said to Moses, "Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you so dealt with us, to bring us up out of Egypt? Is this not the word that we told you in Egypt, saying, 'Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians'? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness."</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Exodus 14:10-12</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good grief, how often is this us? The Lord has done great things for us, and the moment we come up against a trial, one which the Lord led us into, we doubt and complain. The Israelites here wished they could go back to their state of bondage! If only I had a bigger palm to plant on my face...</p>
<p>Yet, the Lord is so beautiful in how He handles us.</p>
<blockquote><p>And Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall see again no more forever. The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.”</p>
<p>And the Lord said to Moses, “Why do you cry to Me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward. But lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. And the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. And I indeed will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them. So I will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen. Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gained honor for Myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Exodus 14:13-18</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Nevertheless, He saved them for His name's sake,<br />
That He might make His mighty power known.<br />
He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it dried up;<br />
So He led them through the depths,<br />
As through the wilderness.<br />
He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,<br />
And redeemed them from their enemies;<br />
There was not one of them left.<br />
Then they believed His words;<br />
They sang His praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Psalm 106:8-12</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When in time of doubt, did the Lord abandon them? When they rebelled, did He just drop them by the side and let them get swallowed up by the Egyptians? Absolutely not! Rather, He took it as an opportunity to manifest His great love toward them, and make Himself a name among the heathen at the same time.</p>
<p>The Lord had given the Egyptians no excuse to rebel against Him. They, too, had seen His great works. Even still, knowing what they were going up against, they remained defiant, obeying Pharoah in His insane endeavor. A pillar of fire before them, they charged between two lofty columns of water miraculously held up, only to have the walls come crashing down on them.</p>
<p>Notice who perished in this instance: it was the captors. The children of Israel were cleansed, so to speak, by the event... And they were also cleansed of that which held them captive. As it was at Calvary, Christ and our sins went to the cross, into the grave, and only Christ came up. So did the evil and the good go into the Red Sea, only for the good to come out; that is, in symbol. It was a washing. We will come back to this theme.</p>
<p>God walked the children of Israel into the trial, that He might save them out of it to His own glory and praise. Does He not do the same with us? Rather than looking upon our trials as difficulties and burdens, we ought to see in them an opportunity for the Lord to be glorified. When we come up against a challenge too difficult for us, it is not an occaision for weeping, but an occaision for the Lord's mighty hand to be revealed!</p>
<p>Sure enough, this mighty victory given by the Lord put joy in the hearts of the Israelites. In that moment, they believed God, they believed His words, and they sang His praises.</p>
<p>But,</p>
<blockquote><p>They soon forgot His works;<br />
They did not wait for His counsel,<br />
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,<br />
And tested God in the desert.<br />
And He gave them their request,<br />
But sent leanness into their soul.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Psalm 106:13-15</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that great victory, it should have been no question in their minds that God had their best interest in mind. He delivered them from their enemies and from certain death. He was leading them by His mighty power. Moreover; He was providing food and water for millions of people in the middle of the desert! They did not lack anything!</p>
<p>Yet, that wasn't good enough. God was giving them the food of angels, the best food you could possibly get, and they wanted unhealthy animal flesh. They complained, and whined, and God let them learn the hard way. He sent them their request, and they gorged themselves so ridiculously that many had heart attacks right there on the spot. Those that gave themselves over to lust found themselves just as dead as that which they were eating.</p>
<p>And who was it that perished? Why, it was the ones who gave themselves up to indulgence and disobedience. God gave them the diet that He intended for them to have, and the people who stepped outside of that brought upon themselves disease and death. Just like at the Red Sea, we have two classes of people that go into this trial, and another purging takes place. The rebellious are washed out, and the rest march on.</p>
<blockquote><p>When they envied Moses in the camp,<br />
And Aaron the saint of the Lord,<br />
The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan,<br />
And covered the faction of Abiram.<br />
A fire was kindled in their company;<br />
The flame burned up the wicked.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>Psalm 106:16-18</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, another rebellion! Unfortunately, throughout their wandering in the wilderness, that's all that is recorded. Rebellion after rebellion takes place, and this time it is a group of people who decide that they should have the right so serve as leadership when God had not appointed them to such a position. They exalted themselves, and God humbled them.</p>
<p>Yet again, a trial arises, and more wickedness is purged out of Israel. Are you seeing a pattern?</p>
<p>For the sake of not taking up too much of your time, we won't recount the rest of the trials which the children of Israel came up against. Each one of these rebellions speaks to something going on in the church today, and moreso that which is continually going on in us.</p>
<p>With the Israelites, God took them out of bondage and led them through the wilderness to the land of promise. It took some time to get there, with many trials arising along the way, and at each trial which came up, God purged more of the wickedness out of Israel. When they got to the edge of the promised land, a final cleansing took place, and the entire generation which was there except for Joshua and Caleb perished. A whole new generation went in and received the land.</p>
<p>This is how the Lord works with us in our Christian walk. He comes in and delivers us from bondage, opening our eyes, and washing us from that which binds us. We have our first love experience with the Lord, and we believe upon His word, and sing His praises. However; it doesn't take long before we come up against a difficulty and begin to exhibit behavior that testifies to the fact that we don't actually believe Him - we don't yet truly trust Him.</p>
<p>Each trial we bear refines us. Through them, God purges us of our wickedness, step by step, on our journey to salvation. At the last, after many trials, the last of our wickedness is taken away, and our old self is laid to rest. Now, it is a renewed, entirely new creature who enters into the promised land.</p>
<p>This is why sanctification is the experience of a lifetime. This is also why we must learn to rejoice in our afflictions. We have a great hope if we will hold fast our faith to the end that God will finish that which He started in us. He is faithful and just to deliver upon His promises, and He promises to take us all the way if we will believe.</p>
<blockquote><p>Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; but exhort one another daily, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end, while it is said:</p>
<p>“Today, if you will hear His voice,<br />
Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”</p>
<p>For who, having heard, rebelled? Indeed, was it not all who came out of Egypt, led by Moses? Now with whom was He angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness? And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey? So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.<br />
...<br />
Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience. For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.<br />
Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
