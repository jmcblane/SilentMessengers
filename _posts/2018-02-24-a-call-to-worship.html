<p>​ I was praying for an object lesson to go along with this study, and I realized that the LORD gave me an object lesson this past week. Life over the past few months has been stressful on me, and as a consequence, I let things go at my humble abode for a while. Next thing you know, my entire space is simply disorganized, to say the least. My guess is, you've probably also, at one point or another, been the victim of having a ridiculously cluttered space.</p>
<p>​ So then, as you well know, having a mess everywhere you look reacts upon you. You just feel dragged down, and overwhelmed; almost like being exhausted, but never having any <em>rest</em>. Nothing is where it should be, everything is out of place, and you're constantly shuffling stuff around to make room so that you can accomplish something else, only making a bigger mess in the process. It can become a tiring nightmare, from which there just simply isn't any <em>rest</em>.</p>
<p>​ Well, I took a Friday and went at it. I turned everything upside down, from room to room, and cleaned the place spotless. Everything was organized, everything found it's place, and after a full day's labor, viola; the place was clean! A weight was lifted off of me, and I breathed a sigh of relief. It was hard work, but in the end, when everything was the way it should be, I found <em>rest</em>. Not only that, but it was easy to maintain for the following week, and I found that cleaning up at the end of the next week didn't take nearly any time at all. When my day for cleaning came, rather than having to work really hard, I found the day to be full of <em>rest</em>. Maintaining the cleanliness was much easier than cleaning up a huge mess, that's for sure!</p>
<p>​ Well, there's a commandment that speaks of taking a rest: the fourth commandment. Often times I see discussion of the fourth commandment dive right down the hole of arguing over which day is the Sabbath day, and what day a Christian should worship on, and it's all just one big back and forth over 'which day is the correct day?' What I don't see as often are examinations of the many other principles which this commandment instructs us with. Is there a <em>certain day</em> in which we are to worship? Is it limited to one day? <em>Why</em> do we rest on one day over another? What's it really all about?</p>
<p>​ I want to look at the fourth commandment with you from four perspectives, none of them addressing which day is the correct day to go to church. There is a correct day of rest, but that's not what I want to focus on at the present time. My position on which day will become quite obvious as you read along, because, when we dig deeper into the principles, we will see that the day you choose is a manifestation of whether or not these principles are alive and working through you.</p>
<p>​ The first text I want us to look at together is found in Revelation 13 and 14. We are living in the time of the fulfillment of this passage, and the events therein are soon to take place. We would do well, then, to understand the issues that are at stake here. One of the ways you can examine a passage and pull out the key idea or issue is by looking for what words are repeated over and over. Take a look at this passage of scripture and see if you can pick out the main idea, what the big issue is, or what is being repeated the most:</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 13:1-8, 11-12, 15-16; 14:9-11</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name. Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like <em>the feet of</em> a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast. So they <strong>worshiped</strong> the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they <strong>worshiped</strong> the beast, saying, “Who <em>is</em> like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?”</p>
<p>  And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will <strong>worship</strong> him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. . . .</p>
<p>  Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to <strong>worship</strong> the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. . . .</p>
<p>  He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not <strong>worship</strong> the image of the beast to be killed. He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, . . .</p>
<p>  Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone <strong>worships</strong> the beast and his image, and receives <em>his</em> mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no <strong>rest</strong> day or night, who <strong>worship</strong> the beast and his image, and whoever<br />
  receives the mark of his name.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ Do you see it? Okay, so maybe I made it a little easier to see what I'm getting at, but pay special attention to what's going on. The conflict is over <em>worship</em>. Those who receive the mark of the beast do so because they are worshiping the beast. By contrast, those who receive the seal of God are worshiping God (see Revelation 14:6-7). Interestingly enough, those who worship the beast have one major problem: they don't have any <em>rest</em>.</p>
<p>​ Is there a commandment that addresses rest? Why yes, there is: the fourth commandment! I submit to you that the problem with those who worship the beast is that they are in violation of the fourth commandment. I further submit that the fourth commandment, perhaps more than any other, teaches in precept what worship is all about. By an examination of the fourth commandment, we will not only learn what true worship is; we will also learn the means by which the mark of the beast is to be avoided, and what the key issues are in these last days. I am probably only breaking the surface here, so as you take these ideas and run with them, please feel free to share what you discover!</p>
<p>​ One thing I would like to note before getting into the four main points here is that the worship of the beast is <em>not</em> outright enmity against God. Rather, the whole world will be found worshiping a power that claims to be the true church of God. We aren't dealing with a system which is <em>against</em> Christianity, but claims to be true Christianity! Notice the following verses:</p>
<p><strong>2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Matthew 24:4,24</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  And Jesus answered and said to them: "Take heed that no one deceives you. . . . For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect."
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ We may demonstrate this through the study of Daniel 7, but I don't think it is entirely necessary for this study in particular. However; I recommend <a href="https://www.amazingfacts.org/media-library/study-guide/e/4992/t/who-is-the-antichrist-">this study guide</a> if you would like to understand the identity of the beast power in Revelation 13 more specifically.</p>
<p>​ That said, the man of sin, this Antichrist power, claims to be Christ. The whole world wonders after the beast, worshiping the dragon, who is Satan. He sits in the temple of God with an overmastering delusion that overtakes the whole world, and not only that, but is so deceptive that if it were possible even the elect would be deceived!</p>
<p>​ Remember Cain and Abel? You see, they represent the two classes which we find at the end of the world. One worships the true God in the correct fashion, and the other claims to be a worshiper of the true God, yet his works reveal that he is not accepted as a worshiper of God. We will be referring back to this story throughout this study.</p>
<p>​ On with it! Let us look at the fourth commandment, and get to our first point:</p>
<p><strong>Exodus 20:8-11</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days <strong>the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them</strong>, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ Notice what the highlighted portion reveals: God created the world in six days! Is this not being challenged today by a large class of professed Christians?</p>
<p>​ If we were to keep in mind this simple fact, it would save us a lot of trouble. The fact that God is the Creator, and we are creatures, is the very first lesson in the good book. Moreover, the way in which God created is spelled out very plainly for us. God created in six days and rested on the seventh day. The first thing that we may draw from this is that, we being creatures, we are under the hand of a power much mightier than we are. Naturally, we owe a certain respect to the hand of one who is all powerful to create us. Indeed, we owe Him everything. Our willing submission to His authority is only natural and reasonable. He knows much better than we do, being far more intelligent than we shall ever be. And <em>who</em> is this person who created us? And <em>how</em> does He create?</p>
<p><strong>Colossians 1:15-17</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  [Jesus] is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>John 1:1-3, 14</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. . . . And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us. . . .
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 33:6,9</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,<br />
  And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth. . . .<br />
  For He spoke, and it was <em>done;</em><br />
  He commanded, and it stood fast.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ I never tire of going over this ground. God, by His Word, created us. He spake, and it was. He said, "Let there be light," and there was light. When God was finished creating, by His Word, everything was in perfect harmony with His Word, because everything was perfectly according to His Word. And, when everything was in order and in harmony with the Word, it was just like having a clean house. God breathed a sigh of relief, and He <em>rested</em>.</p>
<p>​ But that rest did not last. Through transgression of God's Word, His established order of things, <em>unrest</em> entered into the human existence. It was necessary that a plan be executed for the restoration of all things back into harmony with God's word that rest might be restored. And what was that plan?</p>
<p>​ Well, God sent His Word into the world to do a work of <em>re-creation.</em> The same Word, having power to create the world in six days, was sent to <em>re-create</em> and restore the harmony which was lost. God was giving to a world of <em>unrest</em> the gift of <em>re-creation</em>. Get it? <em>Recreation</em>?</p>
<p>​ To reject the six day creation is to reject the authority of the Word of God, and to reject the creative power of the Word. It is, quite frankly, to reject the only means by which we may be saved. If we do not have faith in the creation, by the Word, then we will not have the faith to submit to re-creation according to the Word! These two go hand in hand, because the same power which creates, is able to re-create!</p>
<p>​ And, not to go on a tangent, but the idea that God is the author of death is an attack on His character. To say that God created a world in which we are elevated by death is to say that God designed that death should exist. But the scripture tells us the exact opposite! God is not willing that any should perish, and in fact, His warning to Adam and Eve was explicitly for the purpose that they would not perish! By accepting the idea, we overthrow the Word, and thus reject its transforming power from working in our lives by our unbelief. We must then exalt tradition in the place of scripture, because without the authority of the Word, we have no ground to stand on, and must make our own.</p>
<p>This is exactly what Cain did. Take a look at this excerpt of his experience:</p>
<p><strong>Genesis 4:6-7, 10, 13 (margin)</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  So the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire is for you, but you should rule over it.” . . .<br />
  [God] said [to Cain], “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground. . . .<br />
  And Cain said to the Lord, “My <em>iniquity</em> is greater than I can bear!"
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ Notice: The Lord gave warning, a commandment to Cain, that Cain should not permit sin to rule over him. Cain was given a commandment by the word of the Lord to master sin, and not come under its power. Cain had been resisting the Word of God, and here, Cain chose to reject the Word of God and go his own way. He slew his brother, and when reproved, made excuse for himself, saying "My iniquity is greater than I can bear!" That is, Cain said that sin was too powerful for him.</p>
<p>​ In effect, he was claiming that sin was more powerful than God's Word. What God says is sure, and His word creates the very thing He says. God said to Cain, "Have victory over the sin in your life," and Cain could have taken this by faith and received it. Instead, Cain reject that word, and chose to come under the dominion of sin. He placed his own ways, his own tradition, above the word of God, saying that his inherited tendencies to evil, the traditions he inherited from his father, were more powerful and had more authority than God's word.</p>
<p>​ And after taking this stance, what happened to Cain?</p>
<p><strong>Genesis 4:15b</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  And the Lord set a mark on Cain...
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ Cain was the first to be marked, as a figure of those who should receive the mark of the beast. The first characteristic we see is that of denying God's authority, denying the power of His word, and making sin out to be too powerful to overcome. It is to place tradition as the ruling power in our lives, and to choose our own ways above the ways which God has enjoined by His Word. It is to choose to the opposite of harmony with the Word of God.</p>
<p>​ And who is the Word?</p>
<p><strong>John 1:1,14</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. . . . And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us...
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ Jesus is the Word of God! This brings us to our second point: Harmony with the word of God is harmony with Jesus. To say it plainly, the fourth commandment is calling us to be like Jesus! Notice:</p>
<p><strong>Exodus 20:8-11</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <strong>Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work</strong>: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. <strong>For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day.</strong> Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ <em>Why</em> do we work six days, and rest on the seventh day? It's because God did so. He is our example.</p>
<p>​ Why was it that Cain's offering was not acceptable, but the sacrifice of Abel was acceptable? I will submit to you that it is because one was following the example of God, making God his ideal, and the other was making his own way. Notice:</p>
<p><strong>Genesis 3:21</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Also for Adam and his wife the LORD God made tunics of skin, and clothed them.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ God had set the example before Cain and Abel by taking a lamb himself and sacrificing it to clothe Adam and Eve. By His example, God was showing them what He required of them. He does as He would like us to do, and He shows us how we should be by the way He is. He demonstrates His ideal for us by His own life and actions. John the apostle knew this all too well, and said it quite succinctly thus:</p>
<p><strong>1 John 2:6</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ This, I submit to you, is the essence of what worship is all about.</p>
<p>​ Let's think about it for a second: What is it to idolize someone? Have you ever been asked the question, "Who do you idolize?" or "Who do you aspire to be like?"</p>
<p>​ When we idolize someone, say, a pop star, for instance; the result can be summed up as imitating the one whom we idolize. We dress like them, talk like them, sing their songs, buy their records, put their posters on the wall... We immerse ourselves in them. It's no wonder then that Jesus would call for us to be immersed in His name, or character. He is to be our idol!</p>
<p>​ If we truly love Jesus, if we worship Him, we will imitate Him just like someone imitates their favorite person of fame. We will walk like Him, talk like Him, dress like Him, listen to His music, read His books, and do all the things like He would do. This is the principle of the fourth commandment. Why do we work six days and rest on the seventh? Because God did so, and we are to follow His example!</p>
<p>​ If we want to know which day to go to church, just look to Jesus. If we want to know how we should dress, look at Jesus! If we want to know whether profanity is okay, or if homosexuality is acceptable, or if adultery is okay: We can look to Jesus! We can behold the Word of God! Therein, in our beautiful Creator and Redeemer, and within the pages of His Holy book, are the answers to every pressing issue of our day. Jesus repeated the words which He inspired, saying, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God." We are to take up this example, and receive into our souls the love and character of God to reflect to the world.</p>
<p>​ The problem comes when we don't like what we hear, and we reject His word, but still desire to be called by His name. Which brings us to point three:</p>
<p><strong>Exodus 20:8-11</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <strong>Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work</strong>: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ Which day is the correct day to worship God?</p>
<p>​ Let's rephrase that with our understanding from above:</p>
<p>​ Which day is the correct day to <em>be like Jesus</em>? Which day is the correct day to <em>do God's will</em>?</p>
<p>​ If you said every day, you would be correct. The fourth commandment says, in principle, "six days you shall do My will, and on the seventh day you shall also do My will." It is a commandment to worship God <em>every</em> day by following His example every day. It covers seven days out of the week, not just one!</p>
<p>​ This is what is called <em>abiding</em> in Christ. Today, it is popular to get into Jesus. Everybody wants to be in Christ, wants to be saved. However; abiding is not so popular. Quite often, <em>abiding</em> in Jesus is ridiculed and degraded as legalism, but it is a principle that is enjoined by the fourth commandment. Thus, the fourth commandment is being thrown out today in favor of doing it our way instead of God's way. God calls us to follow His example every day, putting our own ways aside, and doing things His way instead of our way.</p>
<p>Jesus gave a most powerful discourse on what <em>abiding</em> means. Have a look:</p>
<p><strong>John 15:4-14</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  "Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me.</p>
<p>  I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned. If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples.</p>
<p>  As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love.</p>
<p>  These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full. This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends. You are My friends if you do whatever I command you."
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ We could spend a whole day discussing this passage of scripture, but let's hit some of the highlights here. First up, Jesus calls us to abide in Him. In doing so, He is simply reiterating the fourth commandment. Next time someone tells you that the fourth commandment is not found in the New Testament, you can feel free to point them to this passage of scripture!</p>
<p>​ Jesus says that we cannot bear fruit unless we abide. He also says "if My words abide in you," and "if you keep my commandments, you shall abide in My love." Notice, Jesus makes this about Him being our example by saying, "Just as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in His love." Jesus sets the example by keeping the Father's commandments, and calls us to the same lifestyle by His very example and explicit command.</p>
<p>​ When we are first brought into Jesus, we make a lot of changes in our lives. As the road becomes more difficult, the temptation is greater to part ways and do it our own way. This is what Jesus is warning against here. He calls us to abide; to continue in Him. We are not only to live out His word in the things which we approve, but in all points. If we continually obey, continually submit to His will, denying ourselves, we shall abide in Him. If at any point we turn back, and stop following Jesus, we are no longer abiding in Him.</p>
<p>​ And the only way for us to bear fruit is to abide. It is to continually live a Christlike life, being under total consecration to God. Seven days a week, we are called to do the will of God rather than go it our own way and make our own path. We are to walk in the word. If we will do this, we will bear fruit to His glory. Those who do not bear fruit, Jesus sadly reminds us, will be cast into the fire and burned up. That is to say that those who do not abide in Jesus will be cut off and cast away.</p>
<p>​ But, on the brighter side, there is a beautiful message concerning those who bear fruit. When the branches abide in the vine and bear fruit, this attracts people to come and taste of the Vine. When we are abiding in Jesus, naturally we become lights which attract people to the light of the Savior. They see in us that which draws them to Jesus! This is what God wants to do with us. He wants us to reflect His glory so that we will light the way for others to be turned from sin unto salvation!</p>
<p>And this takes us to our fourth and final principle in this study:</p>
<p><strong>Exodus 20:8-11</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. <strong>In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates.</strong> For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ The fourth commandment is a call to evangelism!</p>
<p>​ God has given to every one of us a flock. We have those who are "within our gates," those who within our circle of influence, and we cannot <em>rest</em> in Jesus unless they are resting in Jesus! I may be stretching this a bit far to make a point, but the principle is that our own resting, our own fulfilling of the fourth commandment, is dependent upon those within our gate also resting! We have a responsibility, a stewardship, for the souls within our reach.</p>
<p>​ This reminds me of Moses, who, at the rebellion of the children of Israel, said to God, "if you will forgive their sins-- but if not, blot me, I pray, out of Your book." He was willing to sacrifice his own life in order that Israel might be saved, feeling that his own personal interests were bound up in their salvation. He had a passion, a burning love, for these souls of whom we have on record only a series of rebellions - one after another. He was willing to die on their behalf, just as Jesus did indeed give His life for each and every one of us.</p>
<p>​ This passion, this burning desire; this is what the fourth commandment is calling us to. By faith in the authority and power of God's Word, through the Word made flesh and given unto us for salvation, by God's life flowing through us, and by abiding in that life-giving relationship, we are to bear fruit to attract others to taste and see that the Lord is good. Through our fulfilling of the fourth commandment and resting in God, imitating Jesus, and living out His life, rightly representing and manifesting His character before the world, we are to bring others to the Savior, and cause them to rest in Him, too!</p>
<p>​ We are to reveal a life that is completely out of harmony with the world, and totally in harmony with the Word of God. We are to reveal a power greater than the power of sin. We may show the world, by our lives, that sin hath no more dominion over us, and that love is the life of our souls. When this example is set forth; then will we be fulfilling the fourth commandment.</p>
<p>​ Those who reject this are they who are marked. When the seal of God is placed upon those who "keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus," the rest of the world, professing to worship God, will have denied Him by their enmity towards His character, and their enmity towards the purity of those who are the true worshipers of God. The light will be to the world as a blinding, undesirable thing, and they will seeks to stamp out that which is uncomfortable to their souls, just like they sought to stamp out Jesus.</p>
<p>​ The mark of the beast will be placed on those who profess Christianity, but reveal not the character of Christ. It will be placed on those who do not bear fruit to His glory because they are not daily submitting to Him. They have chosen their own ways, and bring to God an abominable offering. Rather than giving God the true worship which He enjoins -- living a Christlike life -- they bring Him the works of their hands, living a life which they have created which is not according to His Word. They reject the necessity for harmony with the word, rejecting the word, and God does not accept their sacrifice. They persecute their brethren whose sacrifice, being accepted, enrages them.</p>
<p>​ But for those who will remain faithful, as did the Hebrew boys in Daniel 3, the fire will not hurt them. They will stand faultless before God, forgiven and cleansed through the sacrifice of Jesus, and rejoice at the coming of their dear Savior to deliver them from the final enemy of God's people. They will receive the crown of righteousness and immortality, never to perish, and to inherit an incorruptible world made new, according to God's design, where there is no pain, nor sorrow, nor sickness, nor death. They will see what an eternity where love is the heartbeat of all creation, and joy never ends. They will walk with God, and be His people.</p>
<p>​ And, I want to wrap this up with one final point:</p>
<p><strong>Deuteronomy 5:12-15</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day <em>is</em> the Sabbath of the Lord your God. <em>In it</em> you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your<br />
  male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger who <em>is</em> within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. <strong>And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ The Sabbath is given as a sign of those who God has delivered from the bondage of sin. It is God's special sign that He is the one who sanctifies us. (Exodus 31:13). By the mighty power of His word He sets us apart as His own people, holy unto Himself. He brings us out of the pit of sin, causing us to rest on the Rock where we shall never be moved. The Sabbath is a statement to the world that "I am a creature. Jesus is My Creator and my Redeemer. He has lifted me from the pit of sin that I was in, and I love Him, and I honor Him by doing what is right in His eyes. I am His own special treasure, and He is mine. He will restore me, and bring me into His eternal rest, where everything is the way that He created it. I am bound for the promised land, for Jesus is leading me, and I invite you to come with me!"</p>
<p>​ My brother, will you come and go with me? Are you tired of falling on your face, tired of the guilt, sick of sickness, and numb from the pain of broken relationships and a broken world? Have you recognized yet that the way of man is foolishness? Do you long for a better land, a better city, a place to call home? Would you care to see a world where people actually <em>love</em> one another? Do you want to live in a place where there is no more lying, no more death, no more theft... a place where all the people are as Jesus was in this world: righteous, holy, and loving? Do you want to be in a place where God will take care of you, and lead you in the correct way, and show you what is right?</p>
<p>​ God is speaking to your heart even now, and each day, if you will hear Him. He is drawing you with cords of love, drawing you after a better place, because He has it to offer. Will you not consecrate yourself to God and recognize that this life is fleeting? We are all returning to the dirt unless Jesus comes first, and then what? What will all this be when this life is over and we have no more portion under the sun? What are these riches, and these temporal pleasures, in light of eternity?</p>
<p>​ Will you choose Jesus? Will you follow Jesus?</p>
<p>​ And, if you are not decided, will you get to know Jesus?</p>
<p>​ His word tells us that to know Him is eternal life (John 17:3). Taste and see that the Lord is good.</p>
<p>​ There are wonderful Bible studies and resources over at <a href="http://www.amazingfacts.org">Amazing Facts</a>. Jesus invites you, "Come to Me, all <em>you</em> who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you <em>rest.</em> Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke <em>is</em> easy and My burden is light." Are you burdened under your iniquity friends? Jesus wants to give you rest. It is a free gift. He will break those chains that bind you, and set you free. He invites you to learn of Him, and in doing so, He says "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."</p>
<p>​ My friend, make a decision for Jesus. Get to know Him. May we meet somewhere in eternity. Amen.</p>
