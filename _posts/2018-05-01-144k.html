<p>Wrote this up to share with someone, but figured I would place it here for the benefit of many. Enjoy!</p>
<p>--</p>
<p><em>Eternal Father, grant us your Spirit, that we may understand your words aright.</em></p>
<p>The number 144,000 only shows up three places in scripture (that I am aware of). The first two are obvious, and the other is not so obvious. Let's start by examining the obvious, and then the not so obvious reference we shall see fits the scenario like a glove and confirms that we are on the right track.</p>
<p>The two passages concerning the 144,000 are <strong>Revelation 7</strong> and <strong>Revelation 14</strong>. Do read both passages in their entirety before moving on.</p>
<p>In Revelation 7, we find the 144,000 are brought to view during the time of the sixth seal. (See Rev 6:12 and Rev 8:1). Revelation 8:1, the seventh seal, climaxes the seals with the second coming of Christ. How do we know? "there was silence in heaven for about half an hour." Why should there be silence in heaven? What is going on? Compare the following texts:</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 25:31</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span> the holy angels with Him; then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Matthew 24:31</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  And He will send His angels <span style="text-decoration:underline;">with a great sound of a trumpet</span>, and they will gather together His elect...
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Revelation 11:15</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Then the seventh angel sounded (his trumpet): And there were loud voices in heaven, saying, 'The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ...'
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Thess 4:15-17</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">with the trumpet of God</span>. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Cor 15:51-52</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed— in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound</span>, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The seventh seal parallels the seventh trumpet (and likewise the seventh church). We see that at the last trumpet, the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptable - and this event is taking place at the coming of our Lord. Thus, the reason why heaven is silent in the seventh seal is because heaven is empty. Christ comes, and He brings <span style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span> the holy angels with Him. Imagine that!</p>
<p>Thus, in the sixth seal, we are looking at the events preceding the coming of our Lord. See <strong>Revelation 6:15-16</strong> for the context of Revelation 7; it is clearly portraying the people of God at the coming of Christ. If you examine <strong>Revelation 4-5</strong> carefully, you will see the time frame of when the seals begin to be opened coincides with Christ's ascension and inauguration as our High Priest in heaven. This we shall not go into detail now, but I bring this point to you attention to frame the context of the seven seals: they span the time from Christ's ascension until His second coming, and likewise do the seven churches and the seven trumpets. These are three parallel views of the same history; not that this is critical to our understanding of the 144,000; but it helps. We will see this more clearly as we progress anyhow.</p>
<p>Now, let's take notice of <strong>Revelation 7:2-3</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice... saying, "Do not harm... till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then there proceeds to be a list of the number who were sealed among God's people. Take note: the seal of God is placed upon the forehead. Let's compare this with a few texts:</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 14:1</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">having His Father's name written on their foreheads.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>John 6:27</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Labour not for the food which perisheth, but for that food which endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give to you: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">for Him hath God the Father sealed.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Ephesians 4:30</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, by whom ye are sealed to the day of redemption.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Exodus 34:5-7</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and proclaimed the name of the Lord</span>. And the Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing <em>the guilty,</em> visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children’s children to the third and the fourth generation."
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Exodus 13:9</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  It shall be as a sign to you on your hand and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">as a memorial between your eyes</span>, that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the LORD's law</span> may be in your mouth...
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Deuteronomy 6:6-8</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  [In Deut 5, Moses rehashes the ten commandments. Then he proceeds to say...]<br />
  And these words which I comand you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Corinthians 10:4</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  ... For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">that Rock was Christ.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>We see initially that the Father's name is written on their foreheads, and that the seal is placed on their foreheads. This is parallel imagery, letting us know that the seal of God and the name of the Father are one in the same. Being sealed of God is having the Father's name written in the forehead.</p>
<p>We also see that Christ is an example of what it looks like to be sealed.</p>
<p>In Exodus 34, God Himself declares His own name. What is His name? It is a description of His character. Thus, to have the name of God written in the forehead is to have the character of God in your forehead. Christ is the spitting image of the Father. He is the perfect representation of the character of God.</p>
<p>So then, we may conclude that having the Father's name written in the forehead, being sealed, is the state of having been restored in the image of God. That is, being sealed is to have the character or mind of Christ. "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus," says the apostle. But we may go forward some more.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, it was said that the ten commandments were to be bound to the hand and the forehead of the people. The law of God was to be written in their foreheads! The commandments of God, written on stone, were a transcript of the character of Christ. Christ is the Rock, and the ten commandments are a description of Christ's character, which is the standard of righteousness. Hence, you have a rock with writing, which represents Christ the actual Rock, and the writing is a description of Christ.</p>
<p>So then, we see in the same manner that yes, the sealing has to do with restoring the character of Christ in the believers. The 144,000 will have the character of Christ. As it says in <strong>Revelation 14:12</strong>, "Here is the patience of the saints. Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and <em>[have]</em> the faith of Jesus."</p>
<p>Moving forward! There is a transition which takes place in Revelation chapter 7. Let's look at it:</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 7:9, 13-14</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands...</p>
<p>  Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, “Who are these arrayed in white robes, and where did they come from?”</p>
<p>  And I said to him, “Sir, <em>you</em> know.”</p>
<p>  So he said to me, “These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Just prior to this text, we see the 144,000 arranged into companies of thousands; twelve companies of twelve thousand, which essentially consist of twelve smaller companies of a thousand each. What is this arrangement significant of? Let's have a glance at some Old Testament:</p>
<p><strong>Numbers 31:14,48-49</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  But Moses was angry with the officers of the army, with the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">captains over thousands</span> and captains over hundreds, who had come from the battle. ...<br />
  Then the officers who were over thousands of the army, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the captains of thousands</span> and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses; and they said to Moses, “Your servants have taken a count of the men of war who are under our command, and not a man of us is missing.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2 Samuel 18:1</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  And David numbered the people who were with him, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and set captains of thousands</span> and captains of hundreds over them.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Deuteronomy 1:15</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and made them heads over you, leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, leaders of tens, and officers for your tribes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Israel was organized into companies like this when they were on the march for war! Hence, prior to the transition in Revelation 7:9, we see the people of God organized for battle! They are plunging into the great tribulation, the battle of Armageddon, organized and ready to fight the fight of faith against the forces of sin. Then, at the transition, suddenly they are a multitude without number!</p>
<p>The 144,000 went into the great tribulation ready for war, and they came out clean. They survived the great tribulation, and whether or not numbers were added to their ranks, or they just fell out of order, I cannot say. It could be either way, as we will see at the end of this when we get to the last reference of the 144,000 which we haven't seen yet.</p>
<p>Now, this is a good time to address the question: Are these literal Jews who are literally in the literal nation of Israel? Are these people of a Jewish bloodline?</p>
<p><strong>Romans 2:28-29</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><span id="en-NKJV-27991" class="text Rom-2-28">For he is not a Jew who <i>is one</i> outwardly, nor <i>is</i> circumcision that which <i>is</i> outward in the flesh; </span> <span id="en-NKJV-27992" class="text Rom-2-29">but <i>he is</i> a Jew who <i>is one</i> inwardly; and circumcision <i>is that</i> of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise <i>is</i> not from men but from God.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 24:3-6</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Who may ascend into the hill of the Lord?<br />
Or who may stand in His holy place?<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">He who has clean hands and a pure heart</span>,<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Who has not lifted up his soul to an idol,</span><br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Nor sworn deceitfully.</span><br />
He shall receive blessing from the Lord,<br />
And righteousness from the God of his salvation.<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>This</strong> is Jacob, the generation of those who seek Him</span>,<br />
Who seek Your face.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>John 8:37-47</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="text John-8-37"><span class="woj">“I know that you are Abraham’s descendants, but you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.</span> </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26420" class="text John-8-38"><span class="woj">I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you do what you have seen with</span> <span class="woj">your father.”<br />

<p><span id="en-NKJV-26421" class="text John-8-39">They answered and said to Him, “Abraham is our father.”<br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="text John-8-39">Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">“<span style="text-decoration:underline;">If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.</span></span> </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26422" class="text John-8-40"><span class="woj">But now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God.

<p><span class="text John-8-41">Then they said to Him, “We were not born of fornication; we have one Father—God.”</span></p>
<p><span id="en-NKJV-26424" class="text John-8-42">Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">“<span style="text-decoration:underline;">If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God</span>; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me.</span> </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26425" class="text John-8-43"><span class="woj">Why do you not understand My speech?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see, the children of Israel have always been those who are of clean hands and a pure heart, that worship the true God. The true Israel are those who are circumcised in heart. The fleshly bloodline of Abraham may make one seem to be a Jew outwardly, but ultimately, as Jesus makes it clear, this does not make one a child of God.</p>
<p>The children of Israel do the works of Israel, just as the children of God do the works of God. Israel means overcomer, and so he was! Thus, these people here are overcomers! (Hence, all the promises throughout the seven churches to "him that overcometh.")</p>
<p>Those who profess the name of Jesus and act like the devil are just as verily children of the devil as those who do not profess to be Christians and act the same. What makes one a child of God is having the spirit of God. (Rom 8:14). And as many as be Christ's, these are counted for Abraham's seed.  (Gal 3:29). These are the children of Israel.</p>
<p>But what are these palm branches in their hands? (Rev 7:9) What do palm branches have to do with anything?</p>
<p><strong>Leviticus 23:39-41</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep the feast of the Lord <em>for</em> seven days; on the first day <em>there shall be</em> a sabbath-<em>rest</em>, and on the eighth day a sabbath-<em>rest</em>. And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">branches of palm trees</span>, the boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days. You shall keep it as a feast to the Lord for seven days in the year. <em>It shall be</em> a statute forever in your generations. You shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you study the Feast of Tabernacles, you will see that it points to the great harvest (which we shall see in Revelation 14 again). This was the time when they brought in the harvest at the end of the year, and they celebrated, and there was a massive feast. We cannot dig too deeply into it now, but this feast is a figure of the marriage supper of the Lamb when His people have been harvested at the end of the world. (See the parable in Matthew 13.) Hence, the group goes through the great tribulation, and the next thing we see is the imagery that points to the celebration feast after the harvest! Beautiful. We're on the right track!</p>
<p>Let us then jump over to <strong>Revelation 14</strong>. Notice the following:</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 14:3; 15:3</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. ...</p>
<p>  They sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb...
</p></blockquote>
<p>These 144,000 are singing a special song. We sing songs about our experience. Notice the hint, however; this is the song of Moses and of the Lamb. There is something in the experience of Moses and in the experience of Jesus which these folks can especially relate to. On the part of Jesus, let me just point to Gethsemene as a clue. We will come back to Moses. Other than that, you will have to take this and ponder it some more on your own.</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 14:4</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  ...they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed...
</p></blockquote>
<p>What does it mean that they are virgins? We are dealing with a lot of symbolic imagery here. Notice that the fact that they are virgins has something to do with the fact that they follow Jesus.</p>
<p>Question: What is spiritual adultery, or fornication? These folks are not guilty of adultery. Their record has been shed, and they have been renewed into new creatures who no longer commit adultery (having the character of Christ). We may contrast this with mystery Babylon, a harlot woman, who is guilty of fornicating with the kings of the earth and with all the idols of the world.</p>
<p>Anyhow, let's briefly glance at a scripture:</p>
<p><strong>Hosea 4:11-13</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Harlotry, wine, and new wine enslave the heart.<br />
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">My people ask counsel from their wooden idols</span>,<br />
  And their staff informs them.<br />
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">For the spirit of harlotry has caused them to stray,</span><br />
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">And they have played the harlot against their God.</span><br />
  They offer sacrifices on the mountaintops,<br />
  And burn incense on the hills,<br />
  Under oaks, poplars, and terebinths,<br />
  Because their shade is good.<br />
  Therefore your daughters commit harlotry,<br />
  And your brides commit adultery.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, yes; harlotry is idolatry. These people are free from idolatry. They serve the living God, and not a God of their own making. Hence, they follow the Lamb. Pretty straightforward. They do not bow to the image, when all the rest of the world is bowing down to the image of the beast.</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 14:5</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  And in their mouth was found no guile...
</p></blockquote>
<p>What is this? In their mouth is found no guile, or deceit. On the one hand, we can say that they are honest, and they do not lie. But the mouth is not only used for speaking, but eating; and this word here for guile quite literally is a reference to <em>fish bait</em>. They didn't take the bait!</p>
<p>This imagery is borrowed from the Old Testament as well. We see it in a couple places that I can think of off hand:</p>
<p><strong>Amos 4:1-2</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Hear this word, you cows of Bashan,<br />
  who are on the mountain of Samaria,<br />
  Who oppress the poor,<br />
  Who crush the needy,<br />
  Who say to your husbands, “Bring wine, let us drink!”<br />
  The Lord God has sworn by His holiness:<br />
  “Behold, the days shall come upon you<br />
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">When He will take you away with fishhooks,</span><br />
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">And your posterity with fishhooks.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jeremiah 16:16-18</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Behold, I will send for many fishermen,</span>” says the Lord, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">and they shall fish them</span>; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity hidden from My eyes. And first I will repay double for their iniquity and their sin, because they have defiled My land; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable idols.</span>”
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Habakkuk 1:14-17</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Why do You make men like fish of the sea</span>,<br />
  Like creeping things that have no ruler over them?</p>
<p>  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">They take up all of them with a hook</span>,<br />
  They catch them in their net,<br />
  And gather them in their dragnet.<br />
  Therefore they rejoice and are glad.<br />
  Therefore they sacrifice to their net,<br />
  And burn incense to their dragnet;<br />
  Because by them their share is sumptuous<br />
  And their food plentiful.<br />
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Shall they therefore empty their net,</span><br />
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">And continue to slay nations without pity?</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The prophet Amos speaks of a time when judgment shall come, and it shall be like fish who bite into fishhooks. Jeremiah likewise speaks of judgment, when God sends many fisherman, and they catch those fish who take the bait. Habakkuk laments how the wicked are casting out their fishhooks and thus slaying the nations; likening men to fish.</p>
<p>Let me paint a word picture here. You're a fish. Bait is a lie. It represents sin. You're going along, and there's all this bait floating in the water. Someone tossed a bunch of chum in the water, and so you're happily eating it up and enjoying yourself. Day in and day out, you're a pretty fortunate fish, and you keep going right along, eating all this bait without any consequences it seems. Then one day, you take a bite of that bait you love to eat so much, and YANK! They got you, and your time is up. Game over.</p>
<p>That's the picture I see when I read that "in their mouth was found no guile." The enemy has his lies set out like bait, and in the last days, there are going to be hooks in that bait. The time is coming when transgression will be repaid. Those who have made a habit of transgressing, in that great day, will find that the sins they love are full of hooks and will be their doom. The 144,000 on the other hand do not have a taste for bait. They have overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and when all those hooks are baited, they don't fall for the lie. They don't take the bait. They walk right through the day of judgment, ten thousand falling all around, and they are safe because they trust in God and obey Him.</p>
<p>Then we come to this passage that is often called "The three angels' messages." There are three messengers presented here that are sounding the last message of mercy to a dying world. These have the final message of warning for the inhabitants of the earth. We see the warning about turning to the true God, the Creator, the Lord of the Sabbath. We see the message of how Babylon is fallen; the world is united in apostasy, albeit in the name of Christianity! And the third warning, the most solemn of all, when the image of the beast is erected and the world is forced to choose between God and the false Christ.</p>
<p>God's people have always been the embodiment of His messages of warning to the world. He sends the prophets. The message of the 144,000 is this solemn threefold message. They are the one's who are warning the world and proclaiming these messages. I'm not going to develop this point too heavily at the moment; but rather leave you room to ponder!</p>
<p>Let us then notice what happens once this message of warning goes out to the whole world:</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 14:14-20</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat <em>One</em> like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, “Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.” So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.</p>
<p>  Then another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</p>
<p>  And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.” So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw <em>it</em> into the great winepress of the wrath of God. And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses’ bridles, for one thousand six hundred furlongs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes, the harvest! The last message of warning goes out, the whole world is warned, and then the world is plunged into the winepress of the wrath of God - the great tribulation. The whole world is warned, and then once everyone has had a chance, everyone is tried by fire. Those who receive the message find themselves in the image we saw from Revelation 7, and see again in Revelation 15:</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 15:2-3</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  And I saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who have the victory over the beast, over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God. They sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb...
</p></blockquote>
<p>They have passed through the waters above the firmament, and are now standing atop the sea of glass. They are beyond temptation. They have been redeemed! Glorious day! Victory!</p>
<p>Hope this has been helpful to you...</p>
<hr />
<p>Oh... but wait! There is a third reference to the 144,000!</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>This one is not so obvious. Let's walk over to Genesis 15 and look at the prophecy that God gave to Abraham.</p>
<p><strong>Genesis 15:12-16</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, horror and great darkness fell upon him. Then He said to Abram: “Know certainly that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them, and they will afflict them four hundred years. And also the nation whom they serve I will judge; afterward they shall come out with great possessions. Now as for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old age. But in the fourth generation they shall return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites <em>is</em> not yet complete."

<p>Hmm... This fits the pattern we have been reading about. The seed of Abraham shall be strangers in a land that isn't theirs, and will serve them, and shall be afflicted... but they shall be delivered from their tribulation. This sounds just like what happens at the end, how God's people are strangers in the land of mystery Babylon, and they are ministering to them, and Babylon turns to afflict them... but they come out with harps of gold standing on the sea of glass.</p>
<p>This quite literally though, as we are aware, is a reference to the sojourn in Egypt. Notice the timespan: 400 years.</p>
<p>A Hebrew year consists of 360 days. I was reading along one day, having already understood the parallel between the sojourn in Egypt and eschatology, when I read over this text and the question came into my mind: "How many days is 400 years?"</p>
<p>So I did the math. Care to guess?</p>
<p>It's 144,000 days.</p>
<p>You see, the children of Israel went down into Egypt. As they multiplied, they began to be converted by the heathen. Pretty soon there was very little distinction between them and the Egyptians. They forsook the Sabbath, and were most likely observing Sunday like the Egyptians did, for they worshiped the idols of Egypt (as we see evidenced by the golden calf incident). But, there came a time when it was time to commence judgment, or harvest his people from Egypt.</p>
<p>So, God raises up a deliverer, Moses, and prepares him to lead the people out of Egypt. Moses comes, and makes the people to Sabbath, which infuriates Pharoah. Thus, the king of Egypt demands that they shall not rest, but rather work seven days instead. When this decree goes forward, forcing the people to choose between serving God and keeping His Sabbath or serving the king of Egypt and bowing down to his idol, God begins to pour out plagues upon Egypt. Once the plagues are through, Moses leads the people out of Egypt, parting the sea, and taking the people through. All of Pharoah and his company are wiped out.</p>
<p>What is the parallel?</p>
<p>In the last days, God's people have gone down into Babylon, or confusion. Christianity has fallen into apostasy. There isn't much difference between Christians and the world. Christianity likewise, just like in Egypt, has forsaken the Sabbath of God and started keeping Sunday; for they are following after the customs of the idolators from Paganism. But, judgment time is coming.</p>
<p>Thus, God is raising up a deliverer: this 144,000. They are being raised up to warn the people and bring them out of Babylon (Rev 14:8; 18:2). This group of people brings in reformation, bringing people back to the keeping of all ten commandments, and the worship of the true God. They make the people to keep Sabbath. This infuriates the king of mystery Babylon, who raises up an image to himself, and passes a decree that all the world shall bow down to the image of the beast or be slain. The people of the world have to choose between breaking the explicit commandment of God, or obeying God at the risk of their lives. When this happens, God begins pouring out plagues on the world. Then, Jesus comes, and takes His people through the waters above the firmament, parting the sea. All of the wicked down below, including the king of mystery Babylon, are wiped out.</p>
<p>It's a perfect parallel of events. This is why the 144,000 sing the song of the Moses. Moses is a figure of their work in the last days. The number 144,000 points to the days of the time of the sojourn in Egypt. It points to those people who, like Moses, go through the plagues and make it out of the great tribulation.</p>
<p>Hopefully this isn't too much all at once. If you have questions, feel free to ask. God bless!</p>
