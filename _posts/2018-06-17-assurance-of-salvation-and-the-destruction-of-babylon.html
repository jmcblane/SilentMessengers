<p>​ The passage in Isaiah 14 has just been fascinating to me. The more I look at it, the more I can see the culmination of everything that scripture speaks of. Here, the same message which runs through the Bible like a silver lining comes out in a glorious picture, tying together everything from the promise to Adam and Eve all the way down to the last chapter of Revelation. The message, of course, is salvation. That message is Jesus.</p>
<p>​ So what does the fall of Babylon have to do with my assurance of salvation? Let's get started, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 14:3-8,11</strong> NLT</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In that wonderful day when the Lord gives his people rest from sorrow and fear, from slavery and chains, you will taunt the king of Babylon. You will say,</p>
<p>  “The mighty man has been destroyed.<br />
  ​ Yes, your insolence is ended.<br />
  For the Lord has crushed your wicked power<br />
  ​ and broken your evil rule.<br />
  You struck the people with endless blows of rage<br />
  ​ and held the nations in your angry grip<br />
  ​ with unrelenting tyranny.<br />
  But finally the earth is at rest and quiet.<br />
  ​ Now it can sing again!<br />
  Even the trees of the forest—<br />
  ​ the cypress trees and the cedars of Lebanon—<br />
  ​ sing out this joyous song:<br />
  ‘Since you have been cut down,<br />
  ​ no one will come now to cut us down!’
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ The picture here is of one who was a terror to every nation. The whole earth has been dealing with the anger of this individual - the king of Babylon - suffering his continual tyranny. Wickedness has been the ruling principle over all the poor, and their faces have been ground by this power until they are in despair. Hard bondage has been appointed by the rich who live in luxury onto those who dwell in poverty so that the rich might get richer. This is quite the king over the whole world, and yet, this is quite the deliverance!</p>
<p>​ Who is this king of Babylon that shall face such calamity? Who is this man who terrorizes the whole earth?</p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 14:12</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  “How you are fallen from heaven,<br />
  O Lucifer, son of the morning!<br />
  <em>How</em> you are cut down to the ground,<br />
  You who weakened the nations!
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ Why, the king of Babylon is none other than Satan. God here is not talking about a mere man, but <em>the</em> great adversary himself.</p>
<p>​ We can see all throughout scripture the aspiration of Satan to have a worldwide kingdom of corruption. At the time of the flood, the entire world was one in wickedness; so much so that the thoughts and intentions of their hearts were only evil continually. At the tower of Babel, Satan successfully united mankind in opposition to God, which God had to put a stop to else mankind would face his end once again.</p>
<p>​ Studying <a href="https://www.amazingfacts.org/media-library/storacle/e/4894/t/the-millennial-man" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the prophecy of Daniel chapter 2</a>, we see the succession of world empires until the coming of Christ. They are shown to be a conglomerate image, as if all these kingdoms were part of one and the same; and indeed they are. Satan was working through each of the successive empires - Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and the holy Roman empire - to dominate the entire world under his wicked reign. The statue, a conglomeration of these empires, is destroyed at the feet by the kingdom of God - the coming Christ!</p>
<p>​ <a href="https://www.amazingfacts.org/media-library/study-guide/e/4992/t/who-is-the-antichrist-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This same succession is given again in Daniel 7</a>, but this time in greater detail, under the symbolism of beasts. We see the same conglomerate image from Daniel 2, represented by the beasts of Daniel 7, in Revelation 13, again presented. But take a look at the detail that we learn in Revelation 13:</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 13:2</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  ...And the dragon gave the beast his own power and great authority.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Revelation 12:9</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world...
</p></blockquote>
<p>And now, at the end of time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDKG_WFLUi4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is a woman who is riding on this beast.</a> Together, by the working of Satan, they share dominion over the whole world:</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 13:3-4</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast. So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who <em>is</em> like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?”
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Revelation 17:1-6,18</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and talked with me, saying to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters, with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.”</p>
<p>  So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast <em>which was</em> full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication. And on her forehead a name <em>was</em> written:</p>
<p>  MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT,<br />
  THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS<br />
  AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS<br />
  OF THE EARTH.</p>
<p>  I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with great amazement.</p>
<p>  ...</p>
<p>  And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ And here is that Babylon of which God is ultimately speaking. Here is the culmination of the efforts of Satan in all those successive empires to try and make a worldwide empire. The whole world under the rule of this Mystery Babylon - this is what is being spoken of in Isaiah 14, as we will see in further contextual evidence from the chapter itself.</p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 14:13-14</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  For you have said in your heart:<br />
  ‘I will ascend into heaven,<br />
  I will exalt my throne above the stars of God;<br />
  I will also sit on the mount of the congregation<br />
  On the farthest sides of the north;<br />
  I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,<br />
  I will be like the Most High.’</p>
<p>  Yet you shall be brought down to the grave,<br />
  To the lowest depths of the pit.</p>
<p>  “Those who see you will gaze at you,<br />
  And consider you, saying:<br />
  ‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble,<br />
  Who shook kingdoms,<br />
  Who made the world as a wilderness<br />
  And destroyed its cities,<br />
  Who did not open the house of his prisoners?’</p>
<p>  ...you have destroyed your land<br />
  <em>And</em> slain your people.<br />
  The brood of evildoers shall never be named.<br />
  Prepare slaughter for his children<br />
  Because of the iniquity of their fathers,<br />
  Lest they rise up and possess the land,<br />
  And fill the face of the world with cities.”</p>
<p>  “For I will rise up against them,” says the Lord of hosts,<br />
  “And cut off from Babylon the name and remnant,<br />
  And offspring and posterity,” says the Lord.<br />
  “I will also make it a possession for the porcupine,<br />
  And marshes of muddy water;<br />
  I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” says the Lord of hosts.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Lucifer, in his pride, set himself up against God. He made accusations against the government of God, persuading a third of the angels to join with him in his rebellion. God has permitted this apostasy in order that Lucifer's madness might be exposed for what it is. Rather than taking God's word for it, He has allowed all of creation to behold the spectacle that is sin for ourselves. We may now look back with horror as we see the culmination of Satan's hatred of righteousness at the cross of Calvary, which exposes him and lays him bare before all.</p>
<p>​ Satan's kingdom is coming to an end. God will "sweep it with the broom of destruction." He sought to place himself in the place of God on the earth, but he and his kingdom will be brought to nothing. This world shall be burnt up with fervent heat and brought to nothing, and wickedness will be eradicated forever.</p>
<p>​ <strong>Isaiah 14:24-27</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  The Lord of hosts has sworn, saying,<br />
  “Surely, as I have thought, so it shall come to pass,<br />
  And as I have purposed, <em>so</em> it shall stand:<br />
  That I will break the Assyrian in My land,<br />
  And on My mountains tread him underfoot.<br />
  Then his yoke shall be removed from them,<br />
  And his burden removed from their shoulders.<br />
  This <em>is</em> the purpose that is purposed against the whole earth,<br />
  And this <em>is</em> the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.<br />
  For the Lord of hosts has purposed,<br />
  And who will annul <em>it?</em><br />
  His hand <em>is</em> stretched out,<br />
  And who will turn it back?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ This Assyrian, the king of Babylon, Satan, is finished. He shall be cut off, and his yoke upon the necks of the people will be broken. God has promised deliverance from his reign of tyranny; from the slavery that he has laid upon the backs of all people on the earth.</p>
<p>​ And the clincher: "His hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back?" If God has purposed an end to wickedness, it is surely going to be. We can look back on the prophecies and see their fulfillment in utmost clarity. We may from this have absolute assurance that this, too, shall come to pass. The reign of Satan, this great Babylon, will be destroyed.</p>
<p>​ The kingdom of Satan shall cease, and the kingdom of God shall come in. Wickedness shall be no more, and righteousness shall pervade all of creation. "As I have purposed," says the Lord, "so it shall stand."</p>
<p>​ Now let's bring this closer to home.</p>
<p><strong>Luke 17:20-21</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, “The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, ‘See here!’ or ‘See there!’ For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ The Jews in the days of Christ were looking for an earthly deliverance. They were expecting the Messiah to come with pomp and splendor, making war against the Roman empire by force of arms, and delivering them from the Roman yoke. Reading the passage in Isaiah 14, it sounds rather similar, does it not?</p>
<p>​ However; Jesus disappointed their hopes when He said, "The kingdom of God is within you." The kingdom that He came to preach was not an earthly kingdom. He says, "My kingdom is not of this world." The truth of the matter is, the kingdom of God first begins in the heart; and thus it is also with the kingdom of Satan.</p>
<p>​ So why then did Jesus come if not to eradicate wickedness and institute and earthly kingdom of righteousness?</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 1:21</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The name Jesus, equivalent to Joshua in the Hebrew, means <em>salvation</em>. Jesus <em>did</em> come to establish a kingdom of righteousness. He did come to eradicate wickedness... from the hearts of men! He came to save His people <em>from</em> their sins by eradicating sin from within.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 3:8</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ I have come across many that have the mistaken idea that God's wrath is again them because of their ungodliness. I have been victim to this thinking myself. The more I understand the ministry of Christ, the more peace I have with God, and the more I can be sure of victory in Him through faith.</p>
<p>​ Let us fix this scripture in our memories forever:</p>
<p><strong>Romans 5:8</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ Consider the wickedest you have ever been. Think of the very worst, most wretched moment you have ever had. In that moment, Christ looked at you, and said, "I will die for them so that they might be saved."</p>
<p>​ You see, before we ever did anything right, or ever could, Christ loved us and died for us. When we were utterly wretched and spitting in His face, He prayed, "Father, forgive them." His wrath is not towards us, but towards <em>unrighteousness</em>!</p>
<p><strong>Romans 1:18</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all <strong>ungodliness</strong> and <strong>unrighteousness</strong> of men...
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ And rightly so!</p>
<p>​ Picture having a friend who is addicted to alcohol. They're the best friend you have ever had, and you two have been close your whole lives. Now picture finding them in the gutter, laying in their own puke. You pick them up, take them home, wash them up, and let them rest. The next week, you're bailing them out of jail for a bar fight. Again, you're taking them to the hospital for a knife wound they got at some party.</p>
<p>​ The more you love your friend, the more you hate what the alcohol is doing to them. This is the way God sees us and sin.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 6:23</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  For the wages of sin <em>is</em> death, but the gift of God <em>is</em> eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ Picture with me the most attractive of gifts you could imagine. It's a really big wooden box, embroidered with the most beautiful gems, and shining with brilliant silver and gold decoration. There is a giant red ribbon around it, tied in a perfect bow, and there on the tag is your name with a huge heart on it.</p>
<p>​ Now, imagine seeing this, and then God says to you, "Don't open that present. You will surely die."</p>
<p>​ "But it's too tempting. How can I not open it?!"</p>
<p>​ Right?</p>
<p>​ Many of us would imagine that, upon opening the present and finding something nice inside, God says, "Okay, I told you not to open it. I am now punishing you for opening it!"</p>
<p>​ But that's not how it goes. Rather, we open the box, and inside the box is death. God warned us not to open it, and by opening it, we released the trigger, and the thing exploded and killed us.</p>
<p>​ That's how the relationship between us and sin works. God doesn't say "Don't do this or else!" The warning is that sin itself is deadly, and God doesn't want us to die. He loves us too much to not tell us how deadly this thing is that we are so inclined to play with. Sin itself, if attached to us when He comes, will kill us; not Him. And it is in this way that judgment comes upon us.</p>
<p>​ And that's exactly why Christ is in this war against the sin within us. He wants to save us from the thing which threatens to kill us.</p>
<p><strong>2 Peter 3:9</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ He is dedicated to the work of saving us. So long as there is sin in our lives, He is willing and eager to help us in the struggle against it. No matter how low we have sunken, Christ's helping hand is there to lift us up and get us back on our feet again.</p>
<p><strong>John 3:16-17</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ God loved us so much that He looked at Jesus, looked at our wretchedness, and said "Son, the only way to save them is for you to die. I need you to give your life as a ransom to save those wretched sinners." And, astonishingly, Jesus answered, "Here I am. Send me." He loved us so much that He willingly permitted His Son to die in order that we might live. He allowed Jesus to go to the cross for you and me.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 8:31-32</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ Will God then look down upon us now that we are seeking after righteousness and abandon us, when He gave Jesus to die for us before we even cared about Him? No, not at all. Never! He gave everything to see us saved; He will not hold back now. To think that our mistakes can change the heart of God who loved us while we were yet grievous sinners!</p>
<p>​ His work is to get rid of the sin from our lives. It's going to be messy, and it takes time. Just like the farmer plants a tomato crop and nurtures it until the harvest, eagerly awaiting the fruits of his labor; so God sows the seed of righteousness in our hearts, and nurtures it, and eagerly awaits the fruit of righteousness in our characters.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 37:5-6</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Commit your way to the Lord,<br />
  Trust also in Him,<br />
  And He shall bring <em>it</em> to pass.<br />
  He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light,<br />
  And your justice as the noonday.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Proverbs 4:18</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  But the path of the just is like the shining sun,<br />
  That shines ever brighter unto the perfect day.
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ When the dawn arises, it is dim at first. The light grows brighter and brighter over time unto the perfect day. It is not an instantaneous work, but a gradual one, and God knows this and bears with us. He is more eager for us to reach the "measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" than we are! And this is what the new covenant is all about:</p>
<p><strong>Ezekiel 36:22-32</strong> NLT</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Therefore, give the people of Israel this message from the Sovereign Lord: I am bringing you back, but not because you deserve it. I am doing it to protect my holy name, on which you brought shame while you were scattered among the nations. I will show how holy my great name is—the name on which you brought shame among the nations. <strong>And when I reveal my holiness through you before their very eyes, says the Sovereign Lord, then the nations will know that I am the Lord.</strong> For I will gather you up from all the nations and bring you home again to your land.</p>
<p>  “Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. Your filth will be washed away, and you will no longer worship idols. And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive heart. And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations.</p>
<p>  “And you will live in Israel, the land I gave your ancestors long ago. You will be my people, and I will be your God. I will cleanse you of your filthy behavior. I will give you good crops of grain, and I will send no more famines on the land. I will give you great harvests from your fruit trees and fields, and never again will the surrounding nations be able to scoff at your land for its famines. Then you will remember your past sins and despise yourselves for all the detestable things you did. But remember, says the Sovereign Lord, I am not doing this because you deserve it. O my people of Israel, you should be utterly ashamed of all you have done!
</p></blockquote>
<p>​ The Lord has promised to do this work in us. It is His mission to save sinners. "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled!" He wants to reveal His holiness through us, and He has purposed to do so.</p>
<p>​ Just as He has purposed to eradicate wickedness from the earth, so He has purposed to eradicate wickedness from our hearts. He has said, and shall He not do? Let us take Him at His word, and act in faith, trusting in this promise. He has purposed an end to sin in the world, just as He has purposed an end to sin in our lives. "His hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back?"</p>
<p>​ It is God's will for us to inherit the land that was promised to Abraham, "a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness." (2 Peter 3:13). He has said He will do it. He will cleanse us. He will give us the victory through our faith. Let us not be like the unbelieving Israelites who could not enter in because of unbelief, but let us enter into that rest from all our enemies round about. Let us trust that He is working for our good, and then cooperate!</p>
<p>​ When things are out of our control, and the situation is not looking the best, let us remember these things that He has spoken. He has determined that we should be saved from our sins, and it will come to pass. He has determined that there shall be everlasting righteousness, and we shall be fitted to dwell there. Don't give up; just get up! God loves us, and in this warfare, He will never forsake us! He is ever working for our salvation, ever ready to impart grace for victory. He is able to keep us from falling, and sanctify us wholly. (Jude 24; 1 Thess 5:23-24)</p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 60:1-2</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Arise, shine;<br />
  For your light has come!<br />
  And the glory of the Lord is risen upon you.</p>
<p>  For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth,<br />
  And deep darkness the people;<br />
  But the Lord will arise over you,<br />
  And His glory will be seen upon you.
</p></blockquote>
