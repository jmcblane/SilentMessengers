<p>Immigration is the hot topic right now in the United States. The news has been blowing up over the children being separated from their families at the border. Yes, there are cases where the children were not genuinely related to the supposed parents, but were being used; and yes, there are a lot of other things in play, but I want to take the time to put the issue of immigration in the light of the gospel.</p>
<p>It was only today that a message I have been pondering lately clicked in my mind as being tied to immigration. I realized that immigration policy, particularly the immigration policy of heaven, reveals to us a glimpse of the plan of salvation.</p>
<p>In earthly kingdoms, every country has an immigration policy. These can vary wildly, from having an open border, to having a completely closed border, and everything in between. So what is heaven's policy? Who can enter that holy hill? What are the requirements?</p>
<p>God's ways are far above our ways, and examining His immigration policy is the surest way to see clearly through what is going on down here. If we want to know what is right, we need only compare it to the way that the Lord works. When asked the question whether or not it is God's intention to separate families, the obvious answer from every tongue is "No!" and rightly so. But let us put this on the back burner and come back to it later.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
<p><strong>Hebrews 11:13-16</strong> NLT</p>

  All these people died still believing what God had promised them. They did not receive what was promised, but they saw it all from a distance and welcomed it. They agreed that they were foreigners and nomads here on earth. Obviously people who say such things are looking forward to a country they can call their own. If they had longed for the country they came from, they could have gone back. But they were looking for a better place, a heavenly homeland. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
</p></blockquote>
<p>"All these people" is speaking of our patriarchs - the fathers. God had promised Abraham that he and his Seed should inherit a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness forever. Abraham died not owning any land to set his foot on, trusting that God would fulfill in due time that which He had promised. He saw by faith that he should be resurrected to receive this promise, as he learned through his experience with his son Isaac. (See Gal 3:16-17; 2 Peter 3:13; Hebrews 11:17-19)</p>
<p>God has prepared a city, then, for His people. He has promised to Abraham and his Seed; but who is counted for the Seed? Who all can claim this promise of eternal life in a world made new? Who is elligible to apply for entry into the heavenly country?</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Acts 2:39</strong></p><p>
  For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>John 3:16-17</strong></p><p>
  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2 Peter 3:9</strong></p>
    <p>
  The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a beautiful thing: Everyone in the world, from the uttermost to the guttermost, is invited to come to this heavenly country. No doubt, also, that the place is a most desirable place. There is no more hunger, no more pain, no more crying, no more sickness, no more oppression, no more poverty, no more war... What is there not to like about that place? It is the golden land of opportunity. It is the true land of the free.</p>
<p>Everyone there is loving and kind. People there help one another; lift one another up. You don't have to worry about someone stealing your car, or God forbid, your wife. There is peace forevermore, and boredom? Nobody knows what that is. Boredom is a foreign word in that place.</p>
<p>Yet, let us notice an important distinction here between what it means to be invited, and what it means to be accepted. Anyone can submit the application and begin the process of entry. However; not everyone will be approved. Listen carefully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luke 13:23-24; 28</strong></p>
    <p>
  Then one said to Him, “Lord, are there few who are saved?”</p>
<p>  And He said to them, “Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Many will seek to enter, says Jesus, but will not be able to enter. Why is it that they could not enter if everyone is invited? This heavenly country is accepting all applications, but there is some method of screening by which persons are permitted or rejected from entering.</p>
<p>So what then are the qualifications to enter that glorious place? Who can pass the judgment and be accepted?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>John 10:1,7-10</strong></p>
    <p>
  “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. ...<br />
  Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly."
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revelation 22:14</strong></p>
    <p>
  Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 15</strong></p>
    <p>
  Lord, who may abide in Your tabernacle?<br />
  Who may dwell in Your holy hill?</p>
<p>  He who walks uprightly,<br />
  And works righteousness,<br />
  And speaks the truth in his heart;<br />
  He who does not backbite with his tongue,<br />
  Nor does evil to his neighbor,<br />
  Nor does he take up a reproach against his friend;<br />
  In whose eyes a vile person is despised,<br />
  But he honors those who fear the Lord;<br />
  He who swears to his own hurt and does not change;<br />
  He who does not put out his money at usury,<br />
  Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He who does these things shall never be moved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 24:1-6</strong></p>
    <p>
  The earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness,<br />
  The world and those who dwell therein.<br />
  For He has founded it upon the seas,<br />
  And established it upon the waters.</p>
<p>  Who may ascend into the hill of the Lord?<br />
  Or who may stand in His holy place?<br />
  He who has clean hands and a pure heart,<br />
  Who has not lifted up his soul to an idol,<br />
  Nor sworn deceitfully.<br />
  He shall receive blessing from the Lord,<br />
  And righteousness from the God of his salvation.<br />
  This is Jacob, the generation of those who seek Him,<br />
  Who seek Your face. (Selah)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of a truth, Jesus is the way into the city. The requirement for entry is stated very clearly. One must have "clean hands and a pure heart." One must work righteousness, and walk uprightly. It is those that have the character of Christ that are allowed to enter there.</p>
<p>We have all fallen short. We have all failed to reach this standard. None of us are qualified to enter in our current condition. We need two things to prepare us to enter that place: forgiveness and cleansing. Our criminal record must be expunged, and our criminal intents in the heart must be removed.</p>
<p>Notice what this scripture says about the futility of only having your past record expunged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Matthew 7:21-23</strong></p>
    <p>
  Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’
</p></blockquote>
<p>We will never be able to claim merit of ourselves sufficient to enter that city. We don't deserve entry. In fact, the gates are barred shut from us. However; God doesn't like the fact that we are stuck outside. He desperately wants us to be inside with Him, so much so that He was willing to give His Son as a ransom for our entry. He cannot allow us, as we are, to come in; but we can come to Him as we are and be made fit for entry. We may be assimilated into the heavenly culture.</p>
<p>And this is the only sane border policy that God could implement in order to preserve the purity of that place. If just anyone could waltz right in, the place would be a disaster. Everyone is invited, but it is only those who go through the process of learning the culture, learning the laws, learning the language, and all around being assimilated to the spirit of that country who can be allowed in.</p>
<p>Thus, the plan of salvation is a requirement to become a citizen. This is the screening process. The ones who complete the course - who finish the race - are set free to live and work in God's eternal kingdom. Those who do not complete the process are barred from entry by their own unfitness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>John 3:3,5</strong></p>
    <p>
  Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”...<br />
  Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:23-24</strong></p>
    <p>
  Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is the work of God in the plan of salvation to redeem man and make him fit to be a partaker of the inheritence. We cannot save ourselves; but we cannot be saved in indolence and sin either. The Lord does not promise to bring sinners into His kingdom, but to bring ex-sinners into His kingdom; and He Himself with His love and His great sacrifice will do the washing of their feet that prevents them from muddying up the heavenly floors when they get there. We just need to be willing that we should be washed; for He will not force us.</p>
<p>And this brings me to my final point: Citizenship is not determined by any special relations that you might have. I cannot claim that I am from such and such a bloodline, or that I have come from such and such line of succession. This is nothing in the sight of heaven. My fitness is solely based on the merits of Christ and the work He has finished in me.</p>
<p>To illustrate this: Everyone alive has been born of the flesh. All of us are related to Adam, who was the son of God. But are all counted as children of God? Is every one of us a child of God? Where do we draw the line?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>John 8:41-42,44,47</strong></p>
    <p>
  Jesus said, "You do the deeds of your father.”</p>
<p>  Then they said to Him, “We were not born of fornication; we have one Father—God.”</p>
<p>  Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me. ... You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. ... He who is of God hears God’s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.”
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Romans 8:14</strong></p>
    <p>
  For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 John 3:4-6,10,15</strong></p>
    <p>
  Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin. Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him. ... In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.... Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Those who are counted in Christ, those who are considered sons of God, are they who are like Him in character. Those that have received of the Spirit of Christ are counted as heirs. The ones who pursue worldy things, who continue in sin, who follow after the lusts of the flesh - these are counted as children of the devil and children of the world.</p>
<p>But praise be to God that we may be baptized into Christ. We may be partakers of His love, and be made heirs of the kingdom. We are born into this world separated from God, at enmity with His laws, and in need of deep rehabilitation; but God in His infinite mercy passes by our just retribution to raise us back to life and set us on our feet again to walk uprightly. He condescends to bear long with us, teaching us the right way if we will indeed walk therein. He perseveres with us night and day, giving us the assurance that He is able to save to the uttermost. He is willing and able to transplant us from the kingdom of sin into the kingdom of righteousness.</p>
<p>And so, getting into the heavenly country is not as easy as merely walking through an open border. It is not wise to have such a policy; for in that manner you allow wolves among the sheep to devour and consume. Rather, heaven has a proper protocol that one may enter lawfully. Everyone is welcome to go through the training and take the examination. God gives all the help, all the wisdom, all the power to pass the test. There is no reason to skip the process of entry unless you are not willing to comply with the laws of the land in some other fashion; or you know you won't pass the test and aren't interested in changing.</p>
<p>So what then is this business going on at the border, and why is the separation of families and children being used to push an open border policy? Why is Christ being held up as an example of why we should open the borders to every John and Jenny who come our way? This is not the manner of heaven.</p>
<p>The enemy is quite tactful. He pulls on our heart strings, and uplifts that which tugs on our tenderest emotions, so that he can get us in an outrage and slip his crafty designs right past our noses. I don't want to delve into much politics, and I won't, but the open border policy is a figure that illustrates a false gospel. Let us not fall for this. Let us be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</p>
<p>Call me a conspiracy theorist, but there is an ulterior motive going on here; the testimony of scripture shows that this work and this policy is not of God. We need to open our Bibles and get to know our God; for if we don't, our hearts will go after these men who come preaching a Christ that tugs after our carnal hearts, but is not according to the Word.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father, let our eyes be open to the spirit of Antichrist. Amen.</p>
