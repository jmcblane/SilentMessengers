<p>The subject of the keeping of the feasts has been brought to my attention quite a number of times recently, and it seems good that I should put together something in writing for ease of sharing. This is not intended to be exhaustive. As a bit of background; I am Sabbath observant and far from any antinomian persuasion. Obedience to God is a condition of eternal life, as can be plainly read in scripture, and seen in my other written works. However; what shall be demonstrated by this work is that, according to scripture, the keeping of the feast days ceased with the crucifixion of the Messiah. While they still retain incredible importance in understanding not only the plan of salvation but also the book of Revelation; the observance of these feasts is neither required nor possible today.</p>
<p>On to our main subject, then, shall we?</p>
<p>The first place that comes to mind in order to start is the prophecy of the seventy weeks in Daniel 9. We shall conduct a brief examination, assuming prior knowledge, and if you would like a more detailed explanation of this prophecy please see the following link</p>
<p><a href="https://amazingdiscoveries.org/S-deception_Jesus_70-week_prophecy_Daniel">https://amazingdiscoveries.org/S-deception_Jesus_70-week_prophecy_Daniel</a></p>
<p>Daniel is given a most amazing prophecy which points directly to the time when the Messiah should arrive. Hence, when Jesus was baptized, He proclaimed “The time is fulfilled!” What we want to see in particular, however, is what happened to the Messiah. Comparing verses 26 and 27, we find these details:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the sixty-two weeks, Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself</li>
<li>He shall confirm a covenant (the new covenant) for the seventieth week</li>
<li>In the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering</li>
</ul>
<p>The ministry of Christ began at the age of thirty with His baptism. This was His anointing, pointed to in the prophecy. What happened half a week of years, or 3.5 years, from this date? Christ was crucified. “And in the midst of the week, He shall bring and end to sacrifice and offering.”</p>
<p>Hence, with the crucifixion of Christ, the sacrificial system and Levitical priesthood no longer had any relevance. This was signified when the veil was torn in two at Christ’s passing on the cross. The people were able to look directly into the Most Holy place and see that the glory of God no longer resided in that temple, but was hanging on the cross, rejected by the Jewish leadership.</p>
<p>This glory that was to come to this temple was foretold by Haggai as the Messiah. They didn’t recognize Him, because they idolized the temple and not the God of the temple.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Haggai 2:3-9</b></p>
<p>Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts: According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.</p>
<p>For thus saith the Lord of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; And I will shake all nations, and the Desire of All Nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>John 1:14</b></p>
<p>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Psalm 24:10</b></p>
<p>Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory.</p></blockquote>
<p>This problem of idolizing the temple, however, didn’t end with the Jews. Many who had apparently received Christ continued to observe the Mosaic system with its rituals and feasts. We do well, also, to keep in mind that the faithful Jew in the days of Jesus was expected to observe the additional precepts which were heaped upon the law by the Rabbis also. For every ceremonial sabbath, the Rabbis required two. For every inch God asked for, the Rabbis required a mile from the people, and exacted harsh penalties to all who would not comply. They accounted the law of God as nothing, but to transgress the precepts of the Rabbis was punishable by death. Growing up believing as such, that these men were the rightful successors of Moses and should be obeyed as such, it was a hard thing for the Jews to let go of the traditions of men to the simple obedience of faith that God expects - a simple obedience so refreshing that Jesus called it rest. Matthew 11:28.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to our story. After the stoning of Stephen, when the disciples were dispersed and the gospel was going to the Gentiles, it was discovered that the Holy Spirit was given to men who were not circumcised. This seemed contrary to the gospel to many, for they believed that justification required first circumcision and entrance into the Jewish community. They were zealous that these people could not be saved unless they submitted to be circumcised and observe the laws of Moses. However; by scripture and revelation, it was determined that it was not necessary that anyone should be circumcised or keep the law of Moses in order to be saved.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Acts 15:1-2, 24, 28</b></p>
<p>And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</p>
<p>When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. . . .</p>
<p>Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment: … it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things…</p></blockquote>
<p>It was determined once and for all that circumcision and the keeping of the law of Moses was no longer necessary by this council; again, by both scripture and direct revelation of God. This is an extremely important thing to note, and just to be sure, Paul affirms this quite directly:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>1 Corinthians 7:19</b></p>
<p>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God [is what matters].</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Galatians 5:6</b></p>
<p>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Galatians 6:15</b></p>
<p>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what then is the significance of annuling the requirements of circumcision? Notice what the law of Moses says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Deuteronomy 27:26</b></p>
<p>“Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.”</p></blockquote>
<p><b>    </b>If this is the case, then how can I not be circumcised, when the law requires it, without being under the curse of the law?</p>
<p>I think we will readily agree that in order to fulfill the requirements of the law, there can be no supplementing of the law with the traditions of men. Every precept must be kept according to God’s will and word. This we are aware of and affirm quite readily, that no command of God can be altered by the hands of men; but in order to obey God, we must obey Him in Spirit as well as letter. If we change His commands with our human hands, and then seek to fulfill them according to our own design, but do not bring Him what He asked for, we bring to Him the offering of Cain, which He does not accept.</p>
<p>To say that simply, you either do it God’s way or you’re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Let us then observe a few requirements of the Passover, skipping the fact that a sacrifice is required for the moment:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Exodus 12:48-49</b></p>
<p>And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</p>
<p>One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Deuteronomy 16:5-8, 16</b></p>
<p>Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee: But at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents. Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work therein.</p>
<p>Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the Lord empty</p></blockquote>
<p><b>    </b>There are three things I want to point out here in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping the Passover requires circumcision</li>
<li>The Passover can only be sacrificed at the Temple</li>
<li>A pilgrimage to the Temple is required at Passover</li>
</ul>
<p>It necessarily follows that if God requires people to be circumcised to eat the Passover, and God no longer requires circumcision, then God also no longer requires the keeping of the Passover. This is evident also by the fact that Jesus gave the Lord’s supper as a memorial instead of the Passover for us, and the Lord’s supper is not bound to the Jewish religious calendar.</p>
<p>Let us also note, however, that keeping the Passover proper requires a pilgrimage to the temple. The Passover could not just be kept anywhere. But where is the temple? There isn’t one. The Old Covenant has passed, and the earthly temple which accompanied it is forever gone. The New Covenant has a different priesthood, with a heavenly sanctuary, and our Passover in the religious calendar of the heavenly sanctuary is Christ who was sacrificed once for all.</p>
<p>We see these things clearly laid out for us in the book of Hebrews:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Hebrews 7:11-12</b></p>
<p>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</p>
<p>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Hebrews 7:18-19</b></p>
<p>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</p>
<p>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Hebrews 8:1-7, 13</b></p>
<p>Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</p>
<p>For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</p>
<p>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. . . .</p>
<p>In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.7</p></blockquote>
<p>The earthly sanctuary and its priesthood were shadows of grand realities that have to do with Christ and the plan of salvation. The law of Moses, often called simply “the law” by Paul, which was the Old Covenant, based on the promise of the people to obey; this passed away with the death of Christ, who shed the blood that ratified the New Covenant.</p>
<p>The feasts were a part of the Old Covenant with the earthly sanctuary and its priesthood. But, as Paul tells us, this covenant has vanished away, and we are under a new priesthood, and of necessity that means that there is an annulling of the former commandment, and a change in the “law.” The feasts were types, or figures, of greater realities. There is no instruction given in the scripture concerning how these are to be kept under the New Covenant, and it is impossible to keep them according to the Old Covenant, for the earthly priesthood is gone.</p>
<p>This leaves our only option as being to make up our own traditions, and we know that the traditions of men hold no weight with God. In fact, to make up our own traditions and observe them rigidly is to enter into the same folly that the Jews were doing in Christ’s day.</p>
<p>For the last part of this, however, we are going to examine some things from the book of Galatians, touch on a verse in Colossians, and end with the example of Paul Himself as a testimony to whether or not the keeping of the feasts is required of Christians. I believe that thus far we have already proved a conclusive case, but we have some stronger statements to consider on this point even still.</p>
<p>The book of Galatians was directly targeted against the heresy that one must “be circumcised and keep the law of Moses.” Keeping that in mind, we shall jump in after the introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Galatians 2:15-21</b></p>
<p>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</p>
<p>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</p>
<p>For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul says that “through the law” he “died to the law.” Just before this, he makes it clear that he is not talking about relinquishing God’s commandments. The heart of the issue comes in the last sentence: “if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.” If we, through observing outward requirements, could become more perfect and holy, then there is no need that Christ should have died. Christ gave His life a ransom not only that we might find pardon, but that through Him we might be cleansed from our iniquity. He is sufficient for both of these, and there is no outward work, no sacrifice, no ceremony, that I can do which will bring me closer to God. I cannot be justified, or made just, by works of any sort. Being made just is an inner spiritual transformation, and this is what the gospel is about: not the cleanliness of the flesh, and rigorous formalism, but the renewing of the heart and mind in the image of God.</p>
<p>We continue:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Galatians 3:1-3</b></p>
<p>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</p>
<p>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</p>
<p>Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</p></blockquote>
<p>Was it being circumcised that made you right with God, and changed your heart? Having begun a journey of inner transformation, are you now made righteous by outward observances and the ordinances of men? Is formalism what God wants from you?</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Galatians 3:10-14</b></p>
<p>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</p>
<p>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</p>
<p>And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.</p>
<p>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</p>
<p>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</p></blockquote>
<p>The law demands perfect obedience. Every precept regarding the feasts must be observed strictly according to God’s demand, otherwise it is not obedience, and the curse rests upon us. But Christ has delivered us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. And all this is important, because it reveals that salvation does not come through circumcision, and the Gentiles may receive the Holy Spirit without the need for circumcision or the outward observances that come with the Old Covenant. The New Covenant has a different foundation altogether. Paul really digs into how this works in the next passage:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Galatians 3:16-18</b></p>
<p>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see, there never was any salvation through the Old Covenant. It was all just a symbol for the actual plan of salvation that was revealed through the promise made to Abraham. The keeping of all the temple services is a teacher, and not a requirement. How do we reason thus?</p>
<p>We must examine the promises given to Abraham and apply what we are learning above. The promises made to Abraham came before the law given through Moses at Sinai, and this promise contained redemption through Christ outside of the sacrificial system altogether before the feasts ever existed.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Genesis 12:1-3</b></p>
<p>Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:</p>
<p>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</p>
<p>And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Genesis 13:14-15</b></p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy Seed for ever.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Acts 7:2-5</b></p>
<p>Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see, the Lord promised Abraham that through him, all nations would be blessed. He had told Abraham that he was going to give Abraham all the land in every direction as an everlasting possession; and the promise was made to Abraham <i>and</i> to his Seed. However; as Stephen points out, Abraham died not owning so much as to set his foot on.</p>
<p>The promise to Abraham has not yet been fulfilled, and receiving an everlasting possession requires everlasting life. However; we find that the promise wasn’t just to Abraham, or through Abraham, but to Abraham and his Seed. This Seed is Jesus. The promise of receiving the whole world as an everlasting possession was made at this time to Jesus, and thus everyone who is “in Christ.”</p>
<p>And, seeing that Abraham is dead, we also learn that the promise will be fulfilled through the resurrection of the dead; for being resurrected is the only way that Abraham can receive the promise. So, too, Christ was raised from the dead to receive His inheritance, and so we shall be also if we go to sleep before Jesus comes.</p>
<p>This promise, that Abraham and Jesus would inherit the world as an everlasting possession was made before Abraham was circumcised and not after. It was made long before the covenant at Sinai. It is this promise that contains our redemption, for we are inheritors not through the flesh of Abraham, but through the adoption by Christ. This is why Ishmael, who was Abraham’s seed according to the flesh, and who was circumcised in the flesh according to the covenant cut in Genesis 17, was not a recipient of the promise made to Abraham. This is why Jesus could look at the direct descendants of Abraham according to the flesh and tell them they were not Abraham’s children, but children of the devil. The flesh profits us nothing. The promise was not made to Abraham and his children according to the flesh, but to Abraham and his Seed, which is Christ. Thus, the only way for anyone but Abraham to partake of the promise made to Abraham is to be a partaker through Christ and that’s it.</p>
<p>So then the plan of redemption doesn’t require the covenant of circumcision at all. The outward circumcision was only ever a sign or symbol of the circumcision of the heart, which is the law of God written on the heart, which <i>is</i> a requirement of salvation.</p>
<p>And since circumcision was necessary in order to enter into anything to do with the earthly sanctuary, including the keeping of the feasts, it stands to reason that if circumcision isn’t necessary, none of it is necessary. What <i>is</i> necessary is the application of the principles taught in the law to the inward life, that we might learn what sin is and be cleansed of our moral defilement.</p>
<p>Does this mean we do not keep the Sabbath, or that we can eat unclean animals, or that we may fornicate? Absolutely not. Jesus teaches us that the requirements of God are truly greater than the law of Moses even prescribed, as you can see here:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Matthew 19:3-9</b></p>
<p>The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</p>
<p>And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</p>
<p>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</p>
<p>He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice: The law of Moses permitted the divorce of one’s wife, but Jesus points to the creation as testimony that God never intended divorce in the first place. Divorce is not the will of God.</p>
<p>Likewise, from the creation, God demonstrates the example of keeping every seventh day even before Sinai. He ordained the Sabbath on the seventh day of the creation week. From the creation, animals were made clean and unclean, as is evidence by the distinction that Noah makes. Indeed, from the creation, death was not part of God’s design, and it was a sin to eat an animal until after the flood. Truly God’s requirements and ideals are far above what the law of Moses requires, not less.</p>
<p>But let us come back to our text in Galatians that we might see some more plain statements that help us deal with this issue:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Galatians 3:19, 24, 29</b></p>
<p>Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. . . .</p>
<p>Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. . . .</p>
<p>And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sacrificial system was added after sin, because of transgression. It was not a part of God’s original plan in Eden, which is the model of what God is bringing us into when the world is made new. It was temporary, until Christ should come. It taught us lessons to bring us to Christ, and when we receive Christ and His Spirit is given to us, we are heirs according to the promise made to Abraham and not through the Levitical priesthood. We have no obligation to be circumcised or to observe the feasts; but Christ is restoring Eden in us that He might bring us back to Eden.</p>
<p>But this is a hard thing to accept, and many early Christians, called “Judaizers,” found it hard to let go of the requirements of the Old Covenant. Even today, it’s hard to see the distinction without prayerful study. Many go to the extreme of throwing out obedience and the law of God altogether, as if sin were legalized by the death of Christ, because they misunderstand what’s actually being taught here. However; Paul gets stronger with His words:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Galatians 4:9-11</b></p>
<p>But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?</p>
<p>Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember the context of this passage? This is addressed to the heresy of observing circumcision and the laws of Moses. And what does Paul say? “Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. I am afraid of you.” He calls these ceremonial holy days weak and beggarly elements and bondage.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Galatians 5:1-6</b></p>
<p>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</p>
<p>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</p>
<p>For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</p>
<p>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</p>
<p>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</p></blockquote>
<p>Becoming circumcised on account of salvation makes one a debtor to observe the feasts how God prescribed them, and in attempt to keep the law of Moses, one must keep it to the letter. In order to keep the feasts, we must be circumcised. What temple shall we go to? Shall we resume the sacrifices? No, not at all.</p>
<p>Therefore circumcision is nothing; but God desires faith which works by love.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>1 Samuel 15:22</b></p>
<p>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Psalm 51:16-17</b></p>
<p>For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.</p>
<p>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Galatians 5:11-12, 16</b></p>
<p>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.</p>
<p>I could wish that those who toruble you would even cut themselves off!</p>
<p>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</p></blockquote>
<p>And so we see this rings in harmony with the statement made in Colossians:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Colossians 2:13-17</b></p>
<p>And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the real question is: If this is truly what Paul intends to reveal to us and teach us, did he carry it out in his own life? Did he demonstrate by his example that the keeping of the feasts was not what was important to him? Yes, he did. Notice the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Galatians 2:3</b></p>
<p>Yet not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul didn’t require his fellow laborer to be circumcised; a requirement to keep the feasts. Furthermore, Paul skipped feasts at his leisure. The Passover and Days of Unleavened Bread, according to the law of Moses, required that one make a pilgrimmage to the temple. This said, notice the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Acts 20:1-6</b></p>
<p>And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. These going before tarried for us at Troas. And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</p></blockquote>
<p>In all this travelling, Paul did not make it a point to be in Jerusalem for the Passover. He was not in a hurry to keep the feast at all, and here he completely disregards it. So what then are we to conclude from verse 16, which tells us Paul was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem for the Day of Pentecost?</p>
<p>Paul had been charged numerous times by the brethren that he was teaching folks to forsake Moses, as in Acts 21:21. This indeed he was, and he shows it by skipping the Passover. We read it in his own writings.</p>
<p>Paul was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost, yes, but if he were in a hurry to get there for the keeping of the feast, he should have had the same urgency concerning the Passover and Days of Unleavened bread which he did not keep.</p>
<p>We may also note that the Lord told Paul several times not to go, and Paul directly disobeyed the Lord by going. Paul tells it himself that the Lord told him again and again the fate that he would have if he went in Acts 20:23. Then, the Spirit spoke through the believers at Tyre telling Paul not to go in Acts 21:3-4. After this, he receives another warning from a prophet of God in Acts 21:9-12.</p>
<p>Paul was zealous to go anyhow, and it seems that he was eager in his zeal to try and win his brethren to the truth. The feast would be the perfect time to do so, because the brethren would be there gathered together from various parts of the field. Great groups would be there in order to witness to them about Jesus.</p>
<p>The Lord attempted to warn him several times that this was futile, and that he should pursue the ministry he had been given, but Paul disobeyed, and for that, his ministry and his usefulness were cut short. He was not able to accomplish the things God wanted to use him for, such as going to Spain (Romans 15:24,28),  although God was able to make the best out of his bad decision.</p>
<p>Paul’s unfortunate compromise in keeping a ceremonial precept which wasn’t even required by the law of Moses in order to appease the heresy of his prejudiced brethren (in order that he might win their confidence) teaches us a powerful lesson. He knew that these things were not necessary, and he had previously set the example that it was so, but in this one instance he put himself in the wrong place at the wrong time by disobeying the Lord, and he also played the hypocrite just as he had rebuked Peter for in the past.</p>
<p>We should ever hold firm to carry out in our lives that which we believe is true and right by the will of God. As Martin Luther said, “I cannot and will not recant anything, for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. Here I stand, I can do no other, so help me God. Amen.” Surely he learned this in part from the folly of Paul, and we should do likewise.</p>
<p>The above scriptures I believe are very clear in pointing out our duty as it pertains to God in the New Covenant under Jesus Christ. We are heirs according to the promise, and not according to the law. We are not debtors to keep the whole law, and therefore not debtors to observe the feasts. We are not debtors to be circumcised, and we are not under the curses of the law (read them!). Rather, we are obligated to “perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord,” a work which demands all the faith and attention we can muster and then much additional Godly intervention to accomplish. We are to look to Jesus, Who is in the true sanctuary not pitched by man, who is our Passover and High Priest. Amen.</p>
