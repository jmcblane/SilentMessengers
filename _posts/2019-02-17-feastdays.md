Herein is an outline which I prepared for a study group. I pray this is helpful to many.

For a more detailed treatment of this subject, the following resource is highly recommended:

Paragraphs are numbered for ease of reference.

1. **Leviticus 23** is the primary passage where the feasts can be seen
   together, in order, in one place.

2. It can be seen from **Exodus 23:14-17** and **Deuteronomy 16:16-17**
   that the feasts were lumped together into three groups according to the
   time of year they took place. There were three spring feasts, commonly
   called "The Days of Unleavened Bread." There was the Pentecost not too
   far after. Finally, in the fall, we find "The Feast of Tabernacles"
   which generally includes the days of trumpets leading up to the Day of
   Atonement.

   These texts also reveal that, three times a year during these periods,
   a pilgrimage to the temple was required.

3. From the above passages, it can be readily seen that the feasts were
   intimately connected with the sanctuary, the nation of Israel, and the
   agricultural cycle of that land.

4. As these things are "shadows," of which the substance is
   Christ**†**, we will briefly examine each one to
   see its fulfillment in Christ.

   **†** Colossians 2:16 

## The Spring Festivals

# Passover

5. The primary text for the Passover and it's institution is Exodus
   12:1-13, 21-28, 43-51. Had the Lord only intended to give the
   Israelites deliverance from physical bondage, the ordinance of the
   Passover would not have been necessary; and therefore the fact the Lord
   gave them the ordinance of the Passover shows that He intended their
   deliverance to be typical of a greater spiritual deliverance from
   spiritual bondage. That deliverance was to come through the fulfillment
   of the Passover lamb, who is Christ. Let us notice just a handful of
   the characteristics associated with the Passover lamb, and how they
   were fulfilled in Christ:

* **A male without blemish** - *Ex 12:5* - Jesus is the only man who never
  sinned. **1 Peter 1:18,19; 2:22; 2 Corinthians 5:21**

* **Slain on the 14th of Nisan** - *Ex 12:6* - Jesus was killed on the
  fourteenth of Nisan, the day of the Passover. **Luke 22:7**
  
* **Slain at twilight** - *Ex 12:6* - Literally "between the
  evenings,"**†** a phrase denoting
  about 3pm; which is also called the ninth hour of the day. **Luke
  23:44-46**

  **†** In the Hebrew mind, there are two evenings. There is
  first the evening of the day, which is from 12 noon to 6pm. Then there
  is the evening of the night, which is from dusk to dawn. Thus, between
  the evenings is a phrase which denotes the time between 12pm and dusk,
  roughly 3pm. Josephus confirms that the lambs were slain at about 3pm in
  his day.

* **Not a bone could be broken** - *Ex 12:46* - When they came to break
  the legs of the men on the crosses, they passed by Jesus, and not one of
  his bones was broken. **John 19:31-34**; **Psalm 34:20**

* **Not allowed to remain overnight** - *Ex 12:10* - So it was that Christ
  was taken down before evening; before the Sabbath began. **Luke
  23:54**

6. Thus we find that Christ meets the criteria of the Passover, and the New
   Testament identifies Him as *our* Passover. Whereas the earthly
   passover lamb signified the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, the
   fulfillment of this symbolic service teaches us of deliverance from sin
   through the death and blood of Christ. **1 Corinthians 5:6-8; Isaiah
   53:7; John 1:29,36; Hebrews 9:13-14; Romans 6:1-7**

# Unleavened Bread

7. Primary passage: **Exodus 12:14-20,31-34,39; 13:3-10**.

8. Leaven is something which works from within and influences the whole of
   whatever it is included. In the sense that it is connected with the
   Passover, leaven is symbolic of the spirit of Egypt, which is
   corruption or sin. This is apparent by Paul's usage in **1 Corinthians
   5:6-8**. Jesus also uses leaven to represent traits of the flesh in
   **Matthew 16:6,11-12** and **Luke 12:1**. Paul uses leaven in
   **Galatians 5:7-9** to represent a false gospel which produces
   disobedience.

10. **Bitter herbs** were included with the Passover lamb and the
    unleavened bread, marking that the experience was bitter, and not
    a delight. We see this fulfilled in the bitter experience of the
    disciples, who were greatly disappointed because of their misunderstanding
    of prophecy; but later rejoiced in the truth as Jesus revealed what
    had actually taken place. **John 20:19; Mark 14:50; Luke 24:44-53**

# Firstfruits

11. Primary passage: **Leviticus 23:9-11**. The firstfruits were offered
    the day after the Sabbath following the Passover. They were the first
    cuttings of the early harvest at the beginning of the year. These were
    waved before the Lord in both gratitude and anticipation of the
    greater harvest to come.

12. Christ is the firstfruits of the great harvest which is to come at the
    end of this world. **1 Corinthians 15:20-23**. He is the pledge and
    anticipation of all those redeemed who will be raised up at His second
    coming.

13. Just as the law declares, Christ was raised up the day after the
    Sabbath. **Mark 16:1-7**

14. Also, just as the priest waved a sheaf before the Lord; a small
    company was resurrected with Christ to be presented before the Father.
    **Matthew 27:52-53**

# Pentecost

15. Fifty days counting from the day of the firstfruits marks the day of
    Pentecost. **Leviticus 23:15-17**. At this time, a special batch of
    leavened bread is made, and the first harvest of the year is
    commenced.

16. Just as leaven is used to denote a fowl or corrupting spirit, leaven
    is also used as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Matthew 13:33

17. Jesus spent forty days with His disciples after the resurrection
    before He ascended. **Acts 1:1-3**. On the very day of Pentecost,
    fifty days after the day of the firstfruits, the Holy Spirit descended
    upon the budding church. **Acts 2:1-4**. This resulted in a great
    early harvest of souls for the kingdom of God. **Acts 2:41,46-47**

18. Comparing **Revelation 4:5** and **Revelation 5:6**, we can see that
    Pentecost commemorates Jesus' entry and inauguration into the holy
    place and priesthood of His ministry in the heavenly sanctuary above,
    where He was anointed as High Priest. See also **Hebrews 8:1-6; Exodus
    30:25-30;** and **Psalm 133**.

### The long, dry summer

19. Thus far, we have seen that the spring feasts commemorate the work of
    Christ while He was on the earth, with the day of Pentecost marking
    His inauguration into His High Priestly ministry in the courts above.

    The land of Canaan experienced what was referred to as the early and
    latter rains.**†**
    In the spring time, there would be plenty of rain. Then,
    all throughout summer, there would be essentially a dought. Following
    this, when fall came, there would be the latter rain, which would
    prepare the ripening second harvest for, well, harvest!
    
    So it is, then, that the fall feasts teach us concerning Christ's work
    in the courts above at the close of this world's history. In this way,
    by faith, we may see what is going on not only on the earth but in the
    courts above while we await the harvest to come at the end of the world.
    **Matthew 13:38-39**

    **†** Some Bible texts mentioning these: James 5:7;
    Deut 11:14; Prov 16:15; Jer 3:3; Jer 5:24 Hos 6:3; Joel 2:23; Zech 10:1.

## The Fall Festivals

# Trumpets

20. Starting on the first day of the seventh month, trumpets were blown
    as a signal that the Day of Atonement, or Day of Judgment, was
    coming. **Leviticus 23:23-25**

21. We can see trumpets being used in other cases as a call to
    obedience, repentance, and an alarm that judgment is coming.
    **Joshua 6:2-5; Ezekiel 33:1-11; Joel 2:1-2,15-17**

22. The first angel in Revelation 14 goes forward proclaiming that the
    hour of His judgment has come, calling all men everywhere to
    repentance. **Revelation 14:6-7**

23. The time when Christ entered the Most Holy place and the Day of
    Atonement began is signified by the prophecy in Daniel 8:14.
    Applying the year day principle, and starting from the date of
    457BC, this prophecy terminates in 1844.**†**
    
    **†** This is covered in
    another lesson. For more on this, see
    https://tinyurl.com/AFrightontime

24. We ought then, in fulfillment of this type, to see a movement
    arising before 1844 to declare that the hour of His judgment had
    come, and that the 2300 days were coming to a close. This we see
    fulfilled in what is known as The Great Second Advent Movement.

25. **Daniel 12:4-9** together with **Revelation 10** reveal the
    catalyst for the movement to be the unsealing of the book of Daniel
    at the "time of the end," which Daniel 12 makes synonymous with the
    end of the 1260 days. In this movement, the type of the feasts of
    Trumpets and the proclamation of the first angel finds their match.

# The Day of Atonement

26. Our primary passages are **Leviticus 23:26-32** and **Leviticus
    16**.

27. Throughout the year, sacrifices on behalf of sin were continually
    offered, and blood would be taken into the sanctuary and sprinkled.
    **Leviticus 4:1-7** gives us an example of this. It was necessary,
    then, that the sanctuary should be cleansed; and this took place on
    the Day of Atonement, once per year. **Leviticus 16:30** reveals
    that not only was the sin being cleansed from record in the
    sanctuary, but also they were cleansed from the people themselves.

28. **Leviticus 16:8-10** shows the separating of the two goats; one,
    a self sacrificing victim on behalf of the transgressors and the
    other blamed as instigator for the sins committed. When the high
    priest came out of the sanctuary after receiving cleansing for the
    sins of the people, he sent the latter goat into the wilderness.
    **Leviticus 16:20-22**

28. **Revelation 11:19** presents to us the central vision of the book
    of Revelation that reveals for the first time the Most Holy place,
    signifying a transition from the holy place to the Most Holy in the
    sanctuary above. The next portion of the book of Revelation, from
    chapters 12 through 15, present a picture of the final crisis that
    divides the world into two categories: The saints, and the
    worshipers of the beast and his image. **Matthew 13:24-30**. These
    events take place between 1844 and the coming of Christ.

29. In the heavenly sanctuary, the sanctuary of the New Covenant, there
    is also a cleansing of the sanctuary. **Hebrews 9:22-24**. This
    means that there is also a cleansing of the people who partake of
    this ministry from their sins. **Hebrews 9:13-14**. 

30. When Christ comes the second time, having left the heavenly
    sanctuary and finished His work, the world is made into
    a "wilderness." It is returned to that state of being "without form
    and void." The whole place is destroyed. **Jeremiah 4:23-26; Isaiah
    24; Isaiah 34:8-12; 2 Peter 3:10-12.** It is at this time that Satan
    is left, "bound", for a thousand years in this wilderness in
    fulfillment of the scapegoat. **Revelation 20:1-3**

# The Feast of Tabernacles

31. **Leviticus 23:33-43** tells us what we know about the Feast of
    Tabernacles. It coincides with the great harvest at the end of the
    year (verse 39). The people were to take palm branches and celebrate
    before the Lord. (verse 40). There is also the dwelling in booths,
    or tents, commemorating the sojourn of the children of Israel as
    they were coming out of bondage into the promised land. (verses
    42-43).

32. The palm branches perhaps point us back to Elim, the place where the
    children of Israel arrived just after they had passed through the
    waters of the Red Sea and their deliverance was accomplished.
    **Exodus 15:27**

33. **Revelation 7:9-14** shows us those who come out of the great
    tribulation, that final crisis, waving palm branches in their hands
    and celebrating their deliverance. Their deliverance is portrayed in
    **Revelation 19** in connection with the second coming of Christ to
    reclaim His bride who has been made ready and purified for the
    Marriage Supper of the Lamb.

34. The great harvest of the redeemed takes place at the second coming,
    after the final crisis which divides the world into those who
    worship God and those who worship Him not. **1 Thessalonians
    14:13-17; Revelation 14:9-20**

35. Just as Moses led the children of Israel through the Red Sea and
    brought them to Elim, Jesus leads His people through the sea of
    glass and takes them to celebrate the marriage supper of the
    Lamb.**†** They live and reign with
    Him a thousand years. **Revelation 15:2-4; 20:4-6; 3:21; 4:6.**
    They then sing the "song of Moses and of the Lamb," just like the
    song of Moses was sang after the Red Sea. **Exodus 15:1-20**

    **†** Make of it what we will, the Bible describes waters
    above the firmament of the sky. See Genesis 1:6-8; Psalm 148:4; Job
    37:18. The story of Noah tells us that windows in the firmament
    were opened to let the waters above come down and rain upon the
    earth. Genesis 7:11; 8:2. See also Ezekiel 1:22,26; 10:1. It is
    these waters above the firmament that constitute the "Red Sea" that
    the redeemed pass through in the final Exodus from this sinful world
    when Jesus comes. Concerning these things, I quote Martin Luther
    speaking of this very subject: “We Christians must be different from
    the philosophers [i.e. scientists] in the way we think about the
    causes of these things. And if some are beyond our comprehension
    (like those before us concerning the waters above the heavens), we
    must believe them and admit our lack of knowledge rather than either
    wickedly deny them or presumptuously interpret them in conformity
    with our understanding.” "Here I, therefore, take my reason captive
    and subscribe to the Word even though I do not understand it."<br />
