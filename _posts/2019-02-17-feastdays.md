title: Daniel and Revelation Timeline
---

So here recently I was motivated/inspired to put together a chart which places the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation side by side. There are other charts of a similar nature that have been made, but none of them really fit the bill with what I was envisioning, and so I could do no other but make one myself. The easy part was sketching it out on paper... And, surprisingly enough, putting it together in a digital format wasn't as hard as I was expecting it to be.

I will be placing this permanently on the resources page as well.

I pray this is a blessing!
