# Header One
## Header Two
### Header Three

I'm writing this to test whether or not I can make a markdown file as a post, and then scatter random <strong>html</strong> throughout that file.

## Test One

I've already put some HTML, but let's try something else:


> This is a block quote.  
> Something that I wrote.  
> Waters, the rod smote.  
> Pharoah did not float.


## Test Two

This is a smiley face. Isn't it nice?

It's really too bad that I couldn't get and LaTeX in here. I would much love the footnote generation. However; i think we could probably manage some footnotes... We shall try that later.
